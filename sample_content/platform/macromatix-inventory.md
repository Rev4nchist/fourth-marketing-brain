# MacromatiX Inventory Management

## Overview

MacromatiX is Fourth's inventory and procurement platform that gives restaurant operators complete visibility into food costs, purchasing, and waste. From purchase-to-pay workflow automation to actual vs. theoretical food cost variance analysis, MacromatiX transforms what is typically the second-largest expense line for restaurants -- cost of goods sold -- into a managed, measurable, and optimizable operation.

Customers using MacromatiX report **2-5% food cost savings** within the first six months and **15% reduction in food waste**, translating directly to bottom-line profit improvement. For a 100-location restaurant chain with $500M in annual revenue and a 30% food cost, a 3% improvement in food cost represents **$4.5 million in annual savings**.

## Core Capabilities

### Purchase-to-Pay Workflow

MacromatiX automates the entire purchasing cycle from order creation through invoice reconciliation.

| Workflow Step | What MacromatiX Does |
|--------------|---------------------|
| **Order creation** | Auto-generates purchase orders based on par levels, forecasted demand, and current inventory |
| **Vendor selection** | Routes orders to preferred vendors based on contract pricing, delivery schedules, and item availability |
| **Order transmission** | Sends POs electronically to vendors via EDI, email, or vendor portal integration |
| **Receiving** | Mobile receiving workflow with quantity and quality verification, weight-based or count-based |
| **Invoice matching** | Three-way match (PO, receiving record, invoice) with automated exception flagging |
| **Approval routing** | Configurable approval workflows by dollar amount, vendor, or exception type |
| **Payment processing** | Approved invoices exported to AP system or processed through integrated payment |

The automated purchase-to-pay workflow reduces **invoice processing time by 60-70%** and catches pricing and quantity discrepancies that manual processes miss.

### Actual vs. Theoretical Food Cost

The actual vs. theoretical (AvT) analysis is MacromatiX's most powerful cost control feature. It compares what food costs should have been -- based on menu items sold and their recipes -- against what was actually purchased and used.

- **Theoretical cost**: Calculated from POS sales mix multiplied by standardized recipe costs
- **Actual cost**: Derived from purchases, beginning and ending inventory, and transfers
- **Variance analysis**: The difference between actual and theoretical identifies where cost leakage occurs -- overportioning, waste, theft, unrecorded comps, or recipe inaccuracy
- **Drill-down**: Variance can be analyzed at the ingredient level, category level, location level, or across the entire enterprise
- **Trend tracking**: Week-over-week and period-over-period variance trends reveal whether corrective actions are working

Operators who actively manage AvT variance typically achieve **actual food cost within 1-2 percentage points of theoretical**, compared to 3-5 points for operators without this discipline.

### Recipe Management

MacromatiX provides a centralized recipe management system that ensures consistency and enables accurate costing.

- **Recipe builder**: Create and maintain recipes with ingredient quantities, preparation steps, and yield factors
- **Sub-recipes**: Support for nested recipes (sauces, dressings, prep items) that roll up into finished menu items
- **Automatic costing**: Recipe costs update automatically when ingredient prices change
- **Nutritional information**: Calculate calories, allergens, and nutritional data from ingredient composition
- **Menu engineering**: Analyze each menu item's profitability (food cost %) alongside its sales popularity to optimize menu composition
- **Version control**: Track recipe changes over time with approval workflows for modifications

### Vendor Management

MacromatiX centralizes vendor relationships and purchasing terms across the entire organization.

- **Vendor catalog**: Master catalog of all vendors with contracted items, pricing, delivery schedules, and minimum order quantities
- **Price tracking**: Historical price trends by item and vendor, with alerts when prices deviate from contracted rates
- **Vendor scorecards**: Performance metrics including on-time delivery, fill rate, quality issues, and pricing accuracy
- **Contract management**: Store and track vendor contracts with expiration alerts and renewal workflows
- **Multi-vendor ordering**: Split orders across vendors automatically based on best pricing or delivery timing

### Waste Tracking

MacromatiX provides structured waste tracking that quantifies a cost most operators only estimate.

- **Waste log**: Mobile interface for recording waste events with reason codes (spoilage, overproduction, preparation error, customer return)
- **Waste cost calculation**: Every waste entry is automatically costed based on current ingredient prices
- **Category analysis**: Waste patterns analyzed by ingredient category, daypart, location, and reason code
- **Waste reduction targets**: Set and track waste reduction goals by location with progress dashboards
- **Correlation analysis**: Connect waste patterns to purchasing and forecasting to identify root causes

Operators implementing structured waste tracking with MacromatiX reduce waste by **15% within the first quarter**, with continued improvement as teams develop waste-awareness habits.

### Inventory Counting

MacromatiX streamlines the inventory counting process with mobile technology and intelligent workflows.

- **Mobile counting**: Count inventory using a smartphone or tablet with barcode scanning
- **Count sheets**: Configurable count sheets organized by storage location (walk-in, dry storage, bar, line)
- **Guided counting**: Step-by-step guided counts that reduce errors and training time for new counters
- **Variance alerts**: Automatic flags when counted quantities deviate significantly from expected levels
- **Blind counts**: Option to hide expected quantities during counting to prevent bias
- **Count scheduling**: Automated reminders and scheduling for periodic inventory counts

## Integration with Fourth iQ

MacromatiX connects to Fourth iQ to enable demand-driven inventory management that goes beyond static par levels.

- **Demand-based ordering**: Fourth iQ demand forecasts drive purchasing recommendations -- order what you need for the next delivery cycle, not a fixed par level that doesn't account for demand fluctuations
- **Waste prediction**: AI models identify items at risk of spoilage based on current inventory levels, forecasted demand, and shelf life
- **Menu mix forecasting**: Predicted sales mix informs prep quantities and ingredient purchasing at the item level
- **Seasonal adjustment**: Purchasing recommendations automatically adjust for seasonal demand patterns, holidays, and promotional periods

This integration closes the loop between what customers will order and what the kitchen needs to have on hand, reducing both waste from over-ordering and stockouts from under-ordering.

## Integration with POS

MacromatiX integrates with all major POS systems to capture the sales data essential for food cost analysis.

| POS System | Integration Type | Data Flow |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Toast | API | Sales mix, modifiers, comps, voids |
| Aloha (NCR) | File-based | Sales mix, menu items, revenue |
| Oracle MICROS | API | Sales mix, revenue, covers |
| Square | API | Sales, items, modifiers |
| Revel | API | Sales mix, revenue, categories |

POS sales data feeds directly into AvT analysis, recipe costing, menu engineering, and demand-driven ordering.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does it take to see food cost savings with MacromatiX?**
A: Most operators begin seeing measurable food cost improvement within 60-90 days of deployment. The initial impact comes from visibility -- simply knowing where cost leakage occurs changes behavior. Within 6 months, operators using AvT analysis and demand-driven ordering typically achieve **2-5% food cost reduction** relative to their baseline.

**Q: Can MacromatiX handle our existing vendor relationships and contracts?**
A: Yes. During implementation, Fourth's team imports your vendor catalog, contracted pricing, and delivery schedules into MacromatiX. The platform supports any number of vendors and accommodates complex pricing structures including volume discounts, promotional pricing, and market-based pricing for commodities.

**Q: Does MacromatiX replace our accounting system?**
A: No. MacromatiX manages the operational side of procurement and inventory -- ordering, receiving, counting, and cost analysis. Approved invoices and cost-of-goods-sold data are exported to your accounting system (R365, Oracle, SAP, QuickBooks, etc.) through standard integrations. MacromatiX and your accounting system work in tandem, with MacromatiX providing the operational detail and your accounting system maintaining the financial record.
