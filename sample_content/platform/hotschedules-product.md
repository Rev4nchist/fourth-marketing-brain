# HotSchedules by Fourth

## Overview

HotSchedules is the **#1 restaurant scheduling application in the industry**, used by over **3 million workers** across more than **20,000 locations**. Now fully integrated into the Fourth platform, HotSchedules combines intelligent auto-scheduling, a real-time shift marketplace, digital manager communication via LogBook, team messaging, and availability management into a mobile-first experience that managers and team members rely on every day.

HotSchedules was built for the reality of restaurant operations -- where schedules change constantly, communication happens on the fly, and the difference between a great shift and a bad one often comes down to having the right people in the right place at the right time.

## Core Capabilities

### Auto-Scheduling

HotSchedules auto-scheduling transforms what was once a multi-hour weekly task into a review-and-approve workflow. The scheduling engine considers:

- **Demand forecasts** from Fourth iQ to match staffing to anticipated customer volume
- **Employee availability** and declared time-off preferences
- **Skills and certifications** to ensure qualified coverage for every role
- **Labor law compliance** including minor labor restrictions, predictive scheduling ordinances, overtime limits, and mandatory rest periods
- **Labor budget targets** to generate schedules that meet service goals at optimal cost
- **Fairness rules** to distribute shifts equitably and prevent scheduling-related dissatisfaction

Managers can generate a complete weekly schedule in minutes, review it for any manual adjustments, and publish it to the team with a single tap. Auto-scheduling reduces **schedule creation time by up to 75%** compared to manual methods and produces schedules that are **12-18% more cost-efficient** on average.

### Shift Marketplace

The HotSchedules Shift Marketplace is a self-service system that lets team members manage shift changes without requiring manager intervention for every swap.

| Action | How It Works | Manager Involvement |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Shift Swap** | Employee posts a shift; qualified coworkers can claim it | Auto-approved if both employees meet role/compliance requirements |
| **Shift Pickup** | Open shifts are posted to eligible team members | Auto-approved based on configurable rules |
| **Shift Drop** | Employee requests to release a shift | Manager approval required (configurable) |
| **Voluntary Time Off (VTO)** | When overstaffed, manager offers VTO; employees can claim | Manager initiates, employee opts in |

The marketplace operates 24/7 on mobile, reducing the phone-tag cycle that consumes manager time. Locations using the Shift Marketplace report **60% fewer manager-mediated schedule changes** and **40% faster shift coverage** when call-outs occur.

### LogBook

LogBook is HotSchedules' digital manager log, replacing the paper communication books still used in thousands of restaurants. LogBook provides structured shift-to-shift communication that ensures nothing falls through the cracks during manager handoffs.

- **Shift notes**: Outgoing managers document key events, issues, maintenance needs, and follow-ups
- **Categorized entries**: Notes are tagged by category (food safety, equipment, staffing, customer issues, etc.) for easy filtering
- **Read receipts**: Incoming managers must acknowledge they've reviewed the log before starting their shift
- **Photo attachments**: Document equipment issues, delivery quality, or cleanliness concerns with photos
- **Location-level history**: Full searchable archive of all log entries, accessible from mobile or desktop

LogBook drives **accountability across shifts** and gives above-store leaders visibility into daily operations at every location without requiring phone calls or site visits.

### Team Messaging

HotSchedules includes secure, work-appropriate team messaging that keeps communication organized and separate from personal messaging apps.

- **Location-based channels**: Messages organized by location and department
- **Broadcast messages**: Managers can send announcements to the entire team or filtered groups
- **Direct messages**: One-on-one communication between any team members
- **Message read tracking**: Managers can see who has and hasn't read important announcements
- **Content policies**: Configurable message retention and content guidelines enforced at the platform level

Unlike consumer messaging apps (GroupMe, WhatsApp), HotSchedules messaging is tied to employment status -- when an employee is terminated, their access is immediately revoked, and message history is retained for compliance purposes.

### Availability Management

Team members manage their own availability directly in the HotSchedules app, eliminating paper forms and reducing scheduling conflicts.

- **Recurring availability**: Set standard weekly availability windows
- **One-time exceptions**: Block out specific dates for appointments, events, or personal needs
- **Time-off requests**: Submit and track PTO, sick time, and unpaid time-off requests with manager approval workflows
- **Preference setting**: Indicate preferred shifts and maximum/minimum hours per week
- **Blackout periods**: Operators can define blackout dates (holidays, major events) when time-off requests are restricted

## Mobile-First Design

HotSchedules was designed mobile-first from the ground up. The experience is optimized for the way restaurant workers actually interact with their schedules -- on their phones, between shifts, often in just a few seconds.

| Capability | Mobile App | Web |

The HotSchedules mobile app is available on iOS and Android and maintains a **4.6+ star rating** across both app stores with over **1 million downloads**.

## Adoption and Scale

HotSchedules benefits from one of the largest network effects in restaurant technology:

- **3 million+ workers** have active HotSchedules accounts
- **20,000+ locations** run schedules through HotSchedules every week
- **85%+ team member adoption** within 30 days of deployment at new locations
- **92% weekly active usage** among team members with active schedules

High adoption rates are driven by the direct value team members receive: visibility into their schedule, control over shift changes, and direct communication with their team and managers.

## Integration with the Fourth Platform

HotSchedules is fully integrated with the broader Fourth Restaurant Operations Suite. When deployed alongside other Fourth modules, HotSchedules becomes even more powerful:

- **Fourth iQ** feeds demand forecasts directly into auto-scheduling for precision staffing
- **Fourth Payroll** receives actual hours worked from HotSchedules time tracking for seamless payroll processing
- **PeopleMatter** syncs new hire data so newly onboarded employees are immediately available for scheduling
- **MacromatiX** uses scheduled labor hours to inform labor-inclusive food cost analysis
- **Fuego** provides earned wage access based on hours tracked through HotSchedules

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can HotSchedules be used standalone, or does it require the full Fourth platform?**
A: HotSchedules can be deployed as a standalone scheduling solution. Many customers start with HotSchedules alone and add other Fourth modules over time. The product is available in the Essentials tier as a core scheduling tool, and its capabilities expand with the Professional and Enterprise tiers as Fourth iQ and advanced analytics are included.

**Q: How quickly can we get HotSchedules deployed across our locations?**
A: HotSchedules can be deployed rapidly. For operators with 50 or fewer locations, self-service deployment typically takes 1-2 weeks. For larger deployments, Fourth's implementation team supports phased rollouts of 50-100 locations per week. The fastest enterprise deployment on record brought 800 locations live in under 6 weeks.

**Q: How does HotSchedules handle multi-location employees who work at more than one site?**
A: HotSchedules supports multi-location employees natively. A single employee profile can be associated with multiple locations, and the scheduling engine will account for hours worked across all locations when calculating overtime, compliance thresholds, and availability conflicts.
