# Fourth Restaurant Operations Suite

## Overview

The Fourth Restaurant Operations Suite is a unified platform that brings scheduling, labor management, inventory, HR, and analytics together under a single login. Launched in April 2025, the Operations Suite eliminates the patchwork of disconnected point solutions that restaurant operators have relied on for years and replaces it with one integrated system built specifically for hospitality.

Most multi-unit operators today manage their workforce across **5-7 separate tools** -- one for scheduling, another for payroll, a third for applicant tracking, yet another for inventory, and so on. Each tool has its own login, its own data model, and its own version of the employee record. Data doesn't flow between systems without custom integrations, and managers waste hours reconciling information that should be consistent everywhere.

The Restaurant Operations Suite solves this by delivering every core module on a shared data platform with a **single employee record, one unified data model, and cross-module analytics** that surface insights no point solution can provide on its own.

## Unified Data Model

At the core of the Operations Suite is Fourth's unified data model. Every module -- from HotSchedules scheduling to MacromatiX inventory to Fourth Payroll -- reads from and writes to the same employee, location, and organizational data. This means:

- **One employee record** travels from hire through onboarding, scheduling, time tracking, payroll, and offboarding without manual re-entry
- **Location hierarchies** are consistent across modules, so a regional director sees the same organizational structure in scheduling as in labor analytics
- **Role and certification data** flows automatically -- when a team member earns a food safety certification in the HR module, it immediately becomes available as a scheduling constraint
- **Real-time labor cost** reflects actual wages, overtime rules, and tip credits because payroll data and scheduling data live in the same system

This architecture eliminates the reconciliation work that consumes hours of manager time each week and removes the data discrepancies that lead to compliance risk.

## What the Suite Includes

| Module | Product | Key Capabilities |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Scheduling** | HotSchedules | AI-driven auto-scheduling, shift marketplace, team messaging, LogBook |
| **Labor Management** | Fourth Workforce | Real-time labor vs. revenue, overtime alerts, compliance automation |
| **Inventory & Procurement** | MacromatiX | Purchase-to-pay, recipe management, food cost variance, waste tracking |
| **HR & Payroll** | Fourth HCM | Full-service payroll, onboarding, benefits, ACA compliance |
| **Talent Acquisition** | PeopleMatter | ATS, job distribution, background checks, digital offer letters |
| **Analytics** | Fourth iQ | Demand forecasting, predictive analytics, custom dashboards |
| **Earned Wage Access** | Fuego | Early wage access, instant tip payout, financial wellness |

## Cross-Module Intelligence

The true power of the Operations Suite emerges when modules share data. Fourth iQ, the platform's AI engine, analyzes information across all modules to deliver insights that siloed tools cannot:

- **Demand-driven scheduling** uses historical sales data from POS integrations combined with labor productivity metrics to generate schedules that match staffing to customer volume at 15-minute intervals
- **Turnover risk scoring** correlates scheduling patterns, shift consistency, pay rates, and engagement signals to identify employees at risk of leaving before they give notice
- **Food cost optimization** connects MacromatiX inventory data with POS sales mix and demand forecasts to recommend purchasing quantities that reduce waste while avoiding stockouts
- **Compliance dashboards** unify labor law requirements with actual scheduling and time data to flag violations before they occur, across all 50 states

Operators using the full suite report **18-25% reduction in time spent on administrative tasks** and **3-5% improvement in labor cost as a percentage of revenue** within the first 12 months.

## Platform Tiers

The Restaurant Operations Suite is available in three tiers to match operators at different stages of growth and operational maturity.

| Capability | Essentials | Professional | Enterprise |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Scheduling (HotSchedules)** | Core scheduling | AI-optimized scheduling | AI + demand forecasting |
| **Time & Attendance** | Clock-in/out, basic rules | Geofencing, break compliance | Full compliance engine |
| **Labor Analytics** | 10 standard reports | 25+ reports, custom builder | Unlimited, Fourth iQ |
| **Inventory (MacromatiX)** | -- | Add-on | Included |
| **Payroll** | -- | Add-on | Included |
| **Applicant Tracking** | -- | Add-on | Included |
| **Earned Wage Access (Fuego)** | -- | Add-on | Included |
| **API Access** | -- | Read-only | Full read/write |
| **Implementation** | Self-service | Guided (4-6 weeks) | White-glove (8-12 weeks) |
| **Support** | Email | Email + phone | Dedicated CSM + priority |

**Essentials** is designed for operators with 2-20 locations replacing paper schedules and manual processes. **Professional** serves growing chains with 20-200 locations that need optimization and compliance automation. **Enterprise** is built for large operators with 200+ locations that want to consolidate all workforce and back-of-house operations onto a single platform.

## Why One Platform Matters

Consolidating onto the Fourth Operations Suite delivers measurable advantages over managing separate point solutions:

- **Lower total cost of ownership**: Customers replacing 5+ tools report **30-40% reduction in total software spend** after accounting for eliminated integration costs, reduced IT overhead, and volume pricing
- **Faster time-to-value**: New modules activate instantly on existing data -- no new implementation, no data migration, no training on a new interface
- **Single vendor accountability**: One contract, one support team, one roadmap. No more finger-pointing between vendors when something breaks
- **Consistent user experience**: Managers and team members learn one interface. Adoption rates for new modules exceed **85% within 30 days** because the experience is familiar
- **Future-ready**: As Fourth releases new capabilities -- advanced AI, predictive analytics, expanded compliance automation -- they become available across the suite without additional integration work

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can we adopt the Operations Suite gradually, or do we need to deploy all modules at once?**
A: Fourth supports phased adoption. Most customers start with scheduling (HotSchedules) and labor management, then add payroll, HR, or inventory modules over time. Because all modules share the same data model, adding a new module does not require re-implementation -- your existing employee, location, and organizational data is already in place.

**Q: How does the Operations Suite integrate with our existing POS system?**
A: Fourth integrates with **200+ POS systems** including Toast, Aloha, Oracle MICROS, Square, and Revel. POS data feeds directly into demand forecasting, labor analytics, and inventory management. Most POS integrations are configured during implementation and require no ongoing IT maintenance.

**Q: What does migration look like for operators currently using multiple point solutions?**
A: Fourth's implementation team manages the full migration. For Enterprise customers, the white-glove implementation typically takes 8-12 weeks and includes data migration from existing systems, configuration of business rules and compliance policies, manager training, and a phased rollout plan. Fourth has completed over **2,000 enterprise implementations** and maintains a dedicated migration team with deep experience in the most common point solutions being replaced.
