# Fuego Earned Wage Access

## Overview

Fuego is Fourth's earned wage access (EWA) product that lets employees access their earned wages before payday and receive instant tip payouts after every shift. Fuego is offered at **$0 cost to the employer** and delivers measurable retention impact -- operators using Fuego report a **40% reduction in employee turnover**, while **73% of Fuego users** say the product reduces their financial stress.

In an industry where **78% of hourly workers live paycheck to paycheck** and financial instability is a leading driver of turnover, Fuego gives restaurant and hospitality operators a powerful, zero-cost retention tool that also serves as a competitive advantage in recruiting.

## How Fuego Works

### Earned Wage Access

Fuego calculates the wages an employee has earned based on hours already worked in the current pay period. Employees can transfer a portion of those earned wages to their bank account or Fuego card at any time, without waiting for the scheduled payday.

| Step | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Hours tracked** | Employee clocks in and out through HotSchedules or Fourth time and attendance |
| **2. Earnings calculated** | Fuego calculates earned wages in real-time based on actual hours, pay rate, and applicable rules |
| **3. Employee requests transfer** | Via the Fuego mobile app, employee requests a transfer of available earned wages |
| **4. Funds delivered** | Money is transferred to the employee's bank account or Fuego card, typically within minutes |
| **5. Payroll reconciliation** | On payday, the employee's regular paycheck reflects wages already accessed via Fuego |

Employees typically have access to **up to 50% of earned wages** at any point in the pay period, with the exact percentage configurable by the employer.

### Instant Tip Payout

For tipped employees, Fuego provides instant access to tips earned during a shift.

- **End-of-shift payout**: Tips calculated by the POS are available for transfer within minutes of the shift ending
- **Credit card tips**: Credit card tips that would normally be held until the next payroll cycle are available immediately
- **Tip pooling support**: For locations using tip pooling, Fuego calculates each employee's pool share and makes it available
- **Cash tip tracking**: Employees can log cash tips received during the shift for record-keeping

Instant tip access is the single most requested benefit among tipped restaurant employees, and locations that offer it see **25% higher applicant volume** for tipped positions compared to locations that hold tips until payday.

## Zero-Cost Employer Model

Fuego operates on a model that generates **$0 cost to the employer**. The economics work as follows:

| Cost Component | Who Pays |
|---------------|----------|
| Platform access | Free to employer |
| Implementation and integration | Free to employer |
| Standard transfers (1-3 business days) | Free to employee |
| Instant transfers | Small fee paid by employee (typically $2.99-$4.99) |
| Fuego card (optional) | Free to employee |
| Employer payroll processing | No change to existing payroll cost |

Fourth does not advance wages from its own balance sheet in the way that some competitors do. Instead, Fuego works within the employer's existing payroll cycle, ensuring that earned wage access does not create cash flow exposure, funding risk, or balance sheet liability for the operator.

## Financial Wellness Tools

Fuego includes financial wellness features that go beyond simple early wage access.

- **Earnings tracker**: Real-time visibility into hours worked and wages earned in the current pay period
- **Spending insights**: Categorized view of where Fuego transfers are being used
- **Savings goals**: Employees can set savings targets and automatically route a portion of each paycheck to a savings account
- **Financial education**: Short-form content on budgeting, saving, and debt management accessible in the app
- **Bill payment reminders**: Notifications tied to recurring bills to help employees plan transfers around payment due dates

These tools address the root causes of financial stress, not just the symptoms. Over time, Fuego users develop better financial habits -- **34% of users** who set up savings goals maintain them for 6+ months.

## Retention Impact

The retention impact of Fuego is significant and well-documented across Fourth's customer base.

| Metric | Without Fuego | With Fuego | Improvement |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Annual turnover rate** | 75-100% | 45-60% | **40% reduction** |
| **90-day new hire retention** | 50-60% | 70-80% | **20 percentage points** |
| **Employee satisfaction (financial)** | 35% satisfied | 73% satisfied | **38 percentage points** |
| **Applicant volume (tipped roles)** | Baseline | +25% | **25% increase** |

For a 200-location QSR operator with 8,000 employees and an average replacement cost of $2,000 per hire, a 40% reduction in turnover saves approximately **$4.8 million annually** in recruiting, training, and lost productivity costs.

## Fuego vs. Competitors

The earned wage access market includes several providers. Fuego's key advantage is its native integration with the Fourth platform, which eliminates the data quality and timing issues that plague bolt-on EWA solutions.

| Capability | Fuego (Fourth) | DailyPay | Payactiv | Instant (Branch) |
|-----------|---------------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Employer cost** | $0 | Per-employee fee or employee-paid | Per-employee fee | $0 (employee-paid transfers) |
| **Payroll integration** | Native (Fourth Payroll) | API integration required | API integration required | API integration required |
| **Time data source** | Native (HotSchedules) | Requires separate integration | Requires separate integration | Requires separate integration |
| **Tip payout** | Instant, native POS integration | Limited | Not available | Limited |
| **Data latency** | Real-time (shared platform) | Hours to days (API sync) | Hours to days (API sync) | Hours to days (API sync) |
| **Implementation time** | Activated in platform config | 4-8 weeks | 4-8 weeks | 2-4 weeks |
| **Financial wellness** | Included | Premium tier | Included | Basic |
| **Employee experience** | Integrated in HotSchedules app | Separate app | Separate app | Separate app |

### Why Native Integration Matters

Bolt-on EWA providers rely on API connections to pull hours-worked data from a separate time and attendance system and then reconcile with a separate payroll system. This architecture creates:

- **Data latency**: Hours may not be reflected in the EWA system for hours or even a full day after the shift
- **Reconciliation errors**: Discrepancies between the EWA provider's records and the payroll system lead to overpayments or underpayments
- **Multiple apps**: Employees must download and manage a separate app with separate credentials
- **Integration maintenance**: IT teams must monitor and maintain the API connection

Fuego avoids all of these issues because it reads from the same database as HotSchedules (time data) and Fourth Payroll (pay rules and deductions). Hours are reflected in real-time, reconciliation is automatic, and the employee experience lives within the app they already use daily.

## Integration with Fourth Payroll

Fuego and Fourth Payroll are designed to work together seamlessly.

- **Automatic deductions**: Wages accessed via Fuego are automatically deducted from the next payroll cycle with no manual processing
- **Tax compliance**: All tax withholding is calculated on the full payroll amount and applied correctly regardless of when wages were accessed
- **Pay stub transparency**: Fuego transfers appear as a line item on the employee's pay stub for full visibility
- **Garnishment compliance**: Fuego respects wage garnishment orders and limits available balance accordingly
- **Multi-state support**: State-specific wage access regulations are enforced automatically

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does Fuego create any cash flow risk for the employer?**
A: No. Fuego operates within the employer's existing payroll funding cycle. Employees access wages they have already earned, and the employer funds payroll on the normal schedule. There is no advance, no loan, and no employer balance sheet exposure. The payroll debit amount on payday simply reflects the net after Fuego transfers have been reconciled.

**Q: Do employees have to download a separate app?**
A: No. Fuego is integrated into the HotSchedules mobile app that employees already use for scheduling, shift management, and team messaging. Employees activate Fuego within their existing app and access earned wages from the same interface where they view their schedule and manage shifts.

**Q: How do we communicate Fuego to our workforce during rollout?**
A: Fourth provides a turnkey communication kit including in-app announcements, manager talking points, break room posters, and digital signage content. Most operators see **50-60% employee enrollment within 30 days** of launch, with adoption continuing to grow through peer referral and manager advocacy. Fourth's customer success team can also support live rollout events at high-priority locations.
