# Fourth HR, Payroll & HCM

## Overview

Fourth's Human Capital Management suite delivers full-service payroll, benefits administration, onboarding, and compliance management built specifically for the hospitality industry. Processing payroll for over **400,000 employees monthly** across all 50 states, Fourth HCM handles the complexities that generic payroll providers struggle with -- tip credit calculations, split-shift premiums, multi-state tipped employees, and the compliance requirements unique to restaurants and hotels.

Unlike horizontal payroll platforms that treat hospitality as an afterthought, Fourth HCM was engineered from the ground up for operators who manage large hourly workforces with high turnover, complex pay rules, and regulatory exposure across multiple jurisdictions.

## Full-Service Payroll

### Hospitality-Specific Payroll Processing

Fourth Payroll handles the pay calculations that make restaurant payroll uniquely challenging:

| Payroll Feature | Fourth HCM | Generic Payroll (ADP, Paychex) |
|----------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **Tip credit calculations** | Native, automated by jurisdiction | Manual configuration required |
| **Tip pooling and distribution** | Built-in with configurable rules | Limited or third-party add-on |
| **Split-shift premiums** | Auto-calculated per state law | Manual tracking |
| **Multi-state compliance** | All 50 states, auto-updated | Available but not hospitality-tuned |
| **Minor pay rates** | Age-based wage tiers automated | Basic support |
| **Tipped minimum wage** | Tracked by jurisdiction, shift, and role | Often requires custom setup |
| **Overtime across locations** | Consolidated across all sites per employee | Requires manual aggregation |
| **Meal and rest break deductions** | Configurable per jurisdiction | Generic rules |

### Payroll Processing Workflow

- **Automatic hours import**: Hours flow directly from HotSchedules time and attendance -- no manual data entry or file uploads
- **Pre-payroll audit**: Automated exception reports flag missing punches, overtime anomalies, and compliance issues before payroll runs
- **Same-day corrections**: Managers can resolve flagged exceptions through the mobile app before payroll closes
- **Multi-frequency support**: Weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, and monthly pay frequencies supported simultaneously across the same organization
- **Direct deposit and pay cards**: Employees choose their preferred payment method through self-service

Fourth Payroll processes with **99.8% first-run accuracy**, meaning fewer corrections, fewer off-cycle checks, and less payroll department time spent resolving errors.

## Tax Filing and Compliance

Fourth handles federal, state, and local tax filing across all jurisdictions where the operator has employees.

- **Automated tax filing**: W-2s, 1099s, quarterly filings, annual reconciliations
- **New jurisdiction setup**: When an operator opens a location in a new state, Fourth registers for state tax accounts and configures withholding automatically
- **Tax law updates**: Regulatory changes are applied to the platform within days of enactment -- operators do not need to track or implement changes themselves
- **Garnishment processing**: Court-ordered wage garnishments calculated and remitted per jurisdiction requirements
- **Year-end processing**: W-2 generation, electronic filing, and employee distribution handled by Fourth

## Benefits Administration

Fourth HCM includes benefits administration designed for the realities of hourly hospitality workforces.

- **Open enrollment management**: Configurable enrollment windows with employee self-service
- **ACA compliance**: Automated tracking of variable-hour employees for ACA eligibility determination, 1094-C/1095-C filing
- **Benefits marketplace**: Medical, dental, vision, life, disability, and voluntary benefits
- **Carrier connectivity**: Electronic enrollment files sent to insurance carriers automatically
- **COBRA administration**: Automated qualifying event tracking and notification

### ACA Compliance

ACA compliance is a major pain point for large hospitality operators with variable-hour workforces. Fourth automates:

- **Hours tracking**: Measurement, stability, and administrative periods tracked per employee
- **Eligibility determination**: Automatic calculation of full-time status based on actual hours worked
- **Offer of coverage**: Documentation of benefits offers and employee elections
- **IRS reporting**: 1094-C and 1095-C forms generated, filed electronically, and distributed to employees
- **Penalty risk dashboard**: Real-time visibility into potential employer shared responsibility payment exposure

## New Hire Onboarding

Fourth's onboarding module turns the traditionally paper-heavy day-one experience into a digital workflow that new hires complete before they arrive.

- **Digital I-9**: E-Verify integrated, Section 1 completed remotely, Section 2 streamlined with document scanning
- **W-4 and state tax forms**: Completed electronically with guided workflows
- **Direct deposit enrollment**: Bank account setup through self-service
- **Policy acknowledgments**: Employee handbook, safety policies, and company-specific documents signed electronically
- **Training assignments**: Orientation modules and required training automatically assigned based on role and location
- **Uniform and equipment**: Size collection and equipment checklist completed before first shift

Operators using Fourth onboarding report **95% paperwork completion before day one**, reducing the administrative burden on managers and getting new hires productive faster.

## PEO Model for Small-Mid Operators

For operators with 20-200 employees who want to offload HR administration entirely, Fourth offers a Professional Employer Organization (PEO) model.

| PEO Benefit | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Co-employment** | Fourth becomes the employer of record for tax and benefits purposes |
| **Master health plan** | Access to large-group medical rates typically unavailable to small employers |
| **Workers' compensation** | Fourth manages the policy, claims, and experience rating |
| **HR support** | Dedicated HR advisor for employee relations, terminations, and compliance questions |
| **Regulatory compliance** | Fourth handles changing labor law requirements across jurisdictions |

The PEO model gives smaller operators enterprise-grade HR capabilities and benefits purchasing power without building an internal HR department.

## Employee Self-Service

Team members access their own HR and pay information through the Fourth mobile app and web portal:

- **Pay stubs**: View and download current and historical pay stubs
- **Tax documents**: Access W-2s and other tax forms
- **Benefits enrollment**: Review and modify benefit elections during open enrollment
- **Personal information**: Update address, emergency contacts, and direct deposit details
- **Time-off balances**: View accrued PTO, sick time, and other leave balances
- **Document library**: Access company policies, handbooks, and training materials

Self-service capabilities reduce inbound HR inquiries by **45-60%**, freeing HR staff to focus on strategic initiatives rather than answering routine questions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does Fourth Payroll compare to ADP or Paychex for restaurants?**
A: Fourth Payroll is purpose-built for hospitality, which means tip credit calculations, split-shift premiums, tipped minimum wage tracking, and multi-location overtime consolidation work natively without custom configuration. Generic providers like ADP and Paychex can be configured to handle some of these requirements, but it typically requires significant setup time, ongoing manual adjustments, and additional modules. Fourth customers who switched from generic payroll providers report **50-70% reduction in payroll processing time** and significantly fewer payroll errors.

**Q: Can Fourth handle payroll for both corporate employees and hourly restaurant workers?**
A: Yes. Fourth Payroll supports salaried, hourly, and tipped employee types simultaneously within the same organization. Corporate office employees on semi-monthly salary and hourly restaurant workers on weekly pay with tip income can be processed in the same payroll system with their respective rules applied automatically.

**Q: What happens if we need to file payroll taxes in a new state when we expand?**
A: Fourth's tax team handles new state registration. When you open a location in a new state, Fourth registers for the required state tax accounts, configures withholding and unemployment tax rates, and begins filing on your behalf. Most new state setups are completed within 5-10 business days of notification.
