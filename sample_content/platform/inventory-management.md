# Fourth Inventory Management

**Inventory Management connects purchasing, production, and cost control in one platform that helps operators reduce waste, protect margins, and maintain consistency across every location.**

## Overview

Inventory Management gives restaurant operators complete visibility into product movement and cost from supplier to plate. It connects purchasing, production, and cash management to ensure every ingredient and dollar are accounted for. Powered by Fourth iQ, it forecasts demand, recommends order adjustments, and alerts teams to potential variances before they become losses. By linking back to sales and labor data, it helps operators make smarter purchasing decisions, maintain tighter control of margins, and drive more predictable profitability across the business.

## Customer Evidence

> "A menu engineering project for one of our new restaurant openings that would have typically taken 80 man-hours was completed in under an hour -- a 98% labor hour reduction. The reason why we're successful is because we have a product like Fourth; they know the business even better than we know it."
