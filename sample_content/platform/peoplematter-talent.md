# PeopleMatter Talent Acquisition

## Overview

PeopleMatter is Fourth's applicant tracking and hiring platform, purpose-built for the high-volume, fast-paced hiring environment of restaurants and hospitality. In an industry where the average turnover rate exceeds **75% annually** and the cost of a single hourly hire ranges from **$1,500 to $3,500** when factoring in recruiting, training, and lost productivity, PeopleMatter delivers the speed and efficiency operators need to keep their locations fully staffed.

PeopleMatter customers achieve **40% faster time-to-hire** and **95% onboarding completion rates**, turning what is often a chaotic, paper-driven hiring process into a streamlined digital workflow from first application to productive first shift.

## Applicant Tracking System

### Job Posting Distribution

PeopleMatter distributes job postings to the channels where hospitality candidates are actively searching, with a single click from the platform.

| Job Board | Integration Type | Features |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|

| **LinkedIn** | Organic + paid | Company page integration, job wrapping |
| **Glassdoor** | Organic | Employer brand page, reviews integration |

Managers can post a position and have it live across all configured channels in under 2 minutes. PeopleMatter tracks source attribution for every applicant, so operators know which channels deliver the best candidates at the lowest cost-per-hire.

### Mobile-First Application

PeopleMatter's application is designed for the mobile reality of hourly job seekers. **82% of hourly applications** are submitted from a mobile device, and lengthy application forms are the single biggest cause of candidate drop-off.

- **3-minute apply**: The standard PeopleMatter application collects essential information (contact, availability, experience, work authorization) in a streamlined mobile flow that takes less than 3 minutes to complete
- **Text-to-apply**: Candidates can text a keyword to a short code to receive a direct link to the application
- **QR code apply**: In-store QR codes on table tents, window signs, or receipts link directly to the location's application
- **Social sign-in**: Apply using Google or Facebook credentials to pre-fill basic information
- **Resume optional**: For hourly roles, PeopleMatter does not require a resume -- the structured application captures the information that actually matters for hiring decisions

The mobile-first design delivers **application completion rates of 78%**, compared to industry averages of 40-50% for traditional ATS platforms.

### Automated Screening and Ranking

PeopleMatter automatically screens and ranks applicants based on configurable criteria, so managers spend their time on the most qualified candidates rather than sifting through every application.

- **Knockout questions**: Configurable disqualifying criteria (age, work authorization, availability mismatch) automatically filter out ineligible applicants
- **Weighted scoring**: Assign weights to factors like availability match, relevant experience, proximity to location, and schedule flexibility
- **Candidate ranking**: Applicants are ranked by composite score, surfacing the strongest candidates at the top of the manager's review queue
- **Availability matching**: Candidates' stated availability is compared against the location's current scheduling gaps to prioritize those who can fill the shifts that need coverage
- **Duplicate detection**: Identifies candidates who have previously applied or been employed, flagging rehire eligibility and prior performance data

### Interview Scheduling

PeopleMatter eliminates the back-and-forth of interview scheduling with self-service booking.

- **Manager availability slots**: Managers define blocks of time available for interviews
- **Candidate self-scheduling**: Qualified candidates receive a link to book their own interview slot
- **Automated reminders**: Text and email reminders sent 24 hours and 1 hour before the interview
- **No-show tracking**: Candidates who don't show are automatically flagged and can be dispositioned
- **Interview guides**: Role-specific interview question templates ensure consistent evaluation

Self-service scheduling reduces time-to-interview by **3-5 business days** compared to manual coordination and significantly decreases no-show rates through automated reminders.

## Digital Offer Letters and Background Checks

### Offer Letters

- **Template library**: Pre-configured offer letter templates by role, location, and employment type
- **Dynamic fields**: Pay rate, start date, location, and schedule auto-populated from the candidate record
- **Electronic signature**: Candidates accept offers digitally from their phone
- **Conditional offers**: Offers can be conditional on background check completion, with automatic progression tracking

### Background Check Integration

PeopleMatter integrates with **Checkr** for fast, compliant background screening.

- **Configurable packages**: Different screening levels by role (basic for crew, enhanced for management)
- **Automatic initiation**: Background checks triggered automatically when candidates reach the screening stage
- **Real-time status**: Check status visible in the candidate pipeline without switching to a separate system
- **Adverse action workflow**: Compliant pre-adverse and adverse action notice process built into the platform
- **Average turnaround**: Standard checks complete in **1-3 business days**

## Onboarding Workflow

PeopleMatter's onboarding module ensures new hires are fully documented and ready to work before their first shift.

- **Paperless day-one**: All employment paperwork (I-9, W-4, state tax forms, direct deposit, policy acknowledgments) completed digitally before the new hire arrives
- **I-9 and E-Verify**: Section 1 completed remotely; Section 2 streamlined with document scanning and integrated E-Verify submission
- **Training assignments**: Required training modules automatically assigned based on role and location
- **Equipment and uniform**: Size collection and equipment checklist completed during onboarding
- **Manager checklist**: Day-one readiness checklist ensures the location is prepared for the new hire
- **Progress tracking**: HR and operations can monitor onboarding completion rates across all locations in real-time

Operators using PeopleMatter onboarding achieve **95% onboarding completion before day one**, compared to 60-70% completion rates with paper-based processes.

## Volume Hiring for QSR

Quick-service restaurant operators face unique hiring challenges: extremely high volume (some locations hire 200+ people per year), minimal differentiation between candidates, and the need to fill positions within days rather than weeks.

PeopleMatter addresses QSR volume hiring with:

- **Batch processing**: Review, advance, and disposition multiple candidates simultaneously
- **Auto-advance rules**: Candidates who meet minimum criteria are automatically advanced to the next stage without manual review
- **Hiring events**: Schedule and manage group hiring events with bulk interview scheduling and on-the-spot offers
- **Seasonal hiring campaigns**: Pre-built workflows for seasonal hiring spikes with configurable start and end dates
- **Location-level autonomy**: GMs can manage their own hiring pipeline while corporate maintains control over branding, compliance, and process standards

QSR operators using PeopleMatter's volume hiring capabilities fill open positions in an average of **5 business days**, compared to the industry average of 10-14 days.

## Integration with the Fourth Platform

PeopleMatter is fully integrated with the Fourth ecosystem:

- **Fourth Payroll**: New hire tax and direct deposit information flows directly to payroll without re-entry
- **HotSchedules**: Onboarded employees are automatically added to the scheduling system with their role, certifications, and availability
- **Fourth iQ**: Turnover prediction models inform proactive hiring -- when iQ identifies a location with elevated turnover risk, PeopleMatter can automatically activate job postings before vacancies occur
- **Fuego**: Earned wage access is offered during onboarding as a retention benefit
