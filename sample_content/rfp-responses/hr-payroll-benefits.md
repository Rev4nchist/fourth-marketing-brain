## Q: Do you offer a PEO model?

**Confidence: GROUNDED** -- Based on verified Fourth PEO offering.

Yes. Fourth offers a Professional Employer Organization (PEO) model designed specifically for small-to-mid-size restaurant operators who want to outsource HR administration, payroll, and benefits management.

### PEO Model Overview

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Structure** | Co-employment model where Fourth becomes the employer of record for tax and benefits purposes while the operator retains day-to-day management control |
| **Target operator** | Typically 1-50 locations; operators who lack dedicated HR staff or want enterprise-level benefits at small-business scale |
| **Services included** | Payroll processing, tax filing, benefits administration, workers' compensation, HR compliance support, employee handbook, and employment practices guidance |

### Benefits of the PEO Model

- **Better benefits pricing**: Fourth's PEO aggregates employees across multiple clients, providing access to medical, dental, and vision plans typically reserved for larger employers. This can result in 10-30% savings on benefits costs compared to small-group market rates.
- **Workers' compensation**: Master workers' comp policy with pay-as-you-go premiums eliminates large upfront deposits and provides better experience-mod management.
- **Compliance support**: Access to Fourth's HR compliance team for employment law questions, termination guidance, and policy development.
- **Reduced administrative burden**: Payroll, tax filing, benefits enrollment, COBRA, ACA compliance, and workers' comp claims are handled by Fourth.

### PEO vs. Standard Fourth Platform

| Feature | Standard Platform | PEO Model |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| Payroll processing | Included | Included |
| Tax filing | Included | Included (Fourth as employer of record) |
| Benefits admin | Operator procures plans | Fourth procures plans (better rates) |
| Workers' comp | Operator procures | Master policy through Fourth |
| HR compliance support | Platform tools | Platform tools + dedicated HR advisor |
| Co-employment | No | Yes |
| Best for | 50+ locations with HR team | 1-50 locations without dedicated HR |

Operators can transition from the PEO model to the standard platform as they grow, with no disruption to employee records or payroll history.
