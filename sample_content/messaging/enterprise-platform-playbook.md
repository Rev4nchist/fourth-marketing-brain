# Fourth Enterprise Platform Playbook

## Platform Overview

Fourth is the leading end-to-end restaurant and hospitality workforce management platform. Our cloud-native solution connects every aspect of workforce operations - from hiring and onboarding through scheduling, time & attendance, payroll, and performance management. With the launch of the **Restaurant Operations Suite** (April 2025), Fourth now unifies workforce management, inventory (MacromatiX), and analytics under a single platform.

### Architecture

Fourth's platform is built on a modern microservices architecture deployed on Microsoft Azure:

- **Cloud-Native**: 99.9% uptime SLA, auto-scaling, multi-region deployment
- **API-First**: RESTful APIs enable integration with 200+ POS, payroll, and HR systems
- **Single Data Model**: Unified employee record across all modules eliminates data silos
- **Mobile-First**: Native iOS and Android apps for managers and team members
- **AI-Powered**: Fourth iQ engine provides demand forecasting, optimization recommendations, and predictive analytics across all modules

### The Six Pillars

1. **Hire & Onboard** (PeopleMatter) - Applicant tracking, digital onboarding, I-9/E-Verify, document management
2. **Schedule & Optimize** (HotSchedules + Fourth iQ) - AI-powered demand forecasting, auto-scheduling, shift marketplace, LogBook
3. **Time & Attendance** - Biometric clock-in, geofencing, break compliance, tip management
4. **Pay & Comply** (Fourth Payroll) - Multi-state payroll, tax filing, ACA compliance, tip credit calculations
5. **Engage & Retain** (Fuego + Performance) - Earned wage access, performance reviews, pulse surveys, recognition
6. **Inventory & Procurement** (MacromatiX) - Purchase-to-pay, recipe management, waste tracking, vendor ordering
