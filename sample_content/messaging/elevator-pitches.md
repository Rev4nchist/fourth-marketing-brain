# Fourth Elevator Pitches

## Overview

These elevator pitches are calibrated for different time constraints and audiences. Each version is written to be delivered verbatim. Select the appropriate pitch based on the context: general networking, executive meetings, or persona-specific conversations. All pitches emphasize Fourth's unique position as the only unified workforce management platform purpose-built for restaurant and hospitality operators.

## General Pitches

### 30-Second Pitch

"Fourth is the workforce management platform built specifically for restaurants and hospitality. We combine AI-powered scheduling, payroll, HR, and inventory management into one unified system. Our platform helps operators reduce labor costs by 2-5%, eliminate compliance risk, and give managers back hours every week so they can focus on guests instead of spreadsheets. We serve over 200,000 restaurant locations worldwide, including brands like Chili's, Noodles & Company, and Whataburger."

### 60-Second Pitch

"Fourth is the only platform purpose-built to solve the workforce challenges unique to restaurants and hospitality. We unify scheduling, payroll, HR, inventory, and analytics into a single system that eliminates the data silos and vendor sprawl operators deal with today. Our AI forecasting engine predicts demand at 15-minute intervals with 95%+ accuracy, so every shift is staffed to match actual business needs, not manager guesswork.

The results speak for themselves. One QSR chain with 2,500 locations reduced labor costs by 3.2%, saving $12 million annually. A casual dining group eliminated $340,000 in Fair Workweek compliance penalties within six months. And operators who deploy our Fuego earned wage access see a 40% reduction in turnover.

We are not a generic HCM vendor that bolted on restaurant features. Hospitality is all we do, and that focus is why 200,000+ locations trust Fourth to run their operations."

### 2-Minute Pitch

"Let me give you the full picture of what Fourth does and why it matters.

Restaurants and hospitality operators face a unique set of workforce challenges. Labor is typically 30-35% of revenue. Turnover runs 70-100% annually. Compliance laws are multiplying, with Fair Workweek regulations now active in six major jurisdictions and expanding. And most operators are managing all of this across 4-6 disconnected software vendors, which means their data is fragmented and their managers are spending hours on admin instead of running the business.

Fourth solves this with a unified platform that covers five core areas: workforce management with AI-powered scheduling and demand forecasting, payroll with hospitality-specific calculations for tips, weighted overtime, and multi-state compliance, HR and HCM for hiring, onboarding, and benefits, inventory and procurement through our MacromatiX module for food cost control, and analytics that tie all of it together into real-time dashboards.

What makes us different from generic HCM platforms is depth and focus. Our compliance engine is maintained by an in-house legal team that tracks labor law changes across all 50 states and auto-updates the rules. Our AI forecasting, which we call Fourth iQ, uses 2+ years of historical data, weather patterns, local events, and day-of-week trends to predict demand at 15-minute intervals. And our Fuego earned wage access product addresses the retention crisis by giving employees instant access to their tips and earned wages after every shift.

The outcomes are significant. Noodles & Company saves $4 million annually through labor optimization. Chili's saved 600 hours per week in manager scheduling time. A 2,500-location QSR chain cut labor costs by 3.2%, which is $12 million a year. And Fuego deployments consistently deliver 40% reductions in turnover.

We serve over 200,000 locations globally, from 5-unit independents to the largest enterprise brands. Our implementation methodology is proven, our integrations cover every major POS and accounting system, and we are the only vendor in this space that can truly be a single platform for the entire back-of-house operation."

## Persona-Specific Pitches

### For CFO

"Fourth directly impacts your two largest controllable costs: labor and food. Our AI scheduling engine has delivered 2-5% labor cost reductions for operators across segments. One chain with 2,500 locations saved $12 million annually. Our compliance engine eliminates the financial exposure from Fair Workweek, overtime, and minor labor law violations. A 180-location casual dining group eliminated $340,000 in compliance penalties within six months of deploying Fourth.

Beyond cost reduction, we simplify your vendor landscape. Operators typically consolidate 4-6 point solutions into one platform, which reduces licensing costs, integration maintenance, and IT overhead. One fast-casual chain saved $800,000 per year through vendor consolidation alone.

From an ROI perspective, Fourth typically pays for itself within the first year through labor cost savings, with compliance risk elimination and vendor consolidation as additional upside."

### For COO

"Fourth gives your operators the tools to run consistent, efficient operations across every location. Our demand forecasting predicts traffic at 15-minute intervals with 95%+ accuracy, which means your schedules match actual business needs instead of relying on manager intuition. Chili's saved 600 hours per week in aggregate manager scheduling time after deploying Fourth, and that time goes directly back to floor management, training, and guest experience.

The compliance automation is equally important for you. As Fair Workweek laws expand, the operational burden of manual tracking becomes unsustainable. Fourth automates schedule change premium calculations, clopening prevention, right-to-rest rules, and advance notice requirements. Your managers do not need to know the law; the system enforces it.

On the inventory side, MacromatiX gives you real-time visibility into food cost, waste, and vendor performance across every location. Actual-versus-theoretical analysis identifies variance at the item level, so you can pinpoint exactly where margin is leaking."

### For CHRO

"Fourth addresses the full employee lifecycle for hospitality. Starting with hiring, our applicant tracking system is built for high-volume hourly recruiting with mobile-first applications, automated screening, and time-to-hire analytics. Onboarding is fully digital, covering I-9, E-Verify, tax forms, and training assignments, all completed before day one.

For retention, Fuego is a significant differentiator. Giving employees instant access to tips and earned wages after every shift has produced a 40% reduction in turnover for deploying operators. In a post-deployment survey, 73% of employees reported reduced financial stress. In a labor market where you are competing with gig economy platforms that pay daily, Fuego levels the playing field.

Our HR module covers benefits administration, ACA compliance tracking, document management, and employee self-service. For smaller operators, we also offer a PEO model that bundles HR, payroll, and benefits with co-employment, reducing administrative burden and often delivering better benefits pricing through scale."

### For CTO

"Fourth eliminates vendor sprawl in your restaurant technology stack. Instead of maintaining integrations between 4-6 separate systems for scheduling, payroll, HR, inventory, analytics, and applicant tracking, you get one platform with native data flow across all modules. One fast-casual chain saved $800,000 annually just in vendor licensing and integration maintenance costs.

On the technical side, Fourth offers a RESTful API for custom integrations and data exchange with your existing BI tools, POS systems, and accounting platforms. We maintain pre-built connectors for all major restaurant POS systems (Toast, Aloha, MICROS, Revel, Square) and accounting systems (SAP, Oracle, QuickBooks).

Security and compliance are enterprise-grade. SOC 2 Type II certified, AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.2+ in transit, role-based access control, and SSO support via SAML 2.0. We operate on AWS infrastructure with 99.9% uptime SLA and maintain full disaster recovery capabilities.

Our architecture is multi-tenant SaaS with configuration-driven customization, so you get the benefit of continuous platform updates without the overhead of managing custom deployments."
