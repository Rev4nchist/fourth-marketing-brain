## Usage Guidelines

- Named customer proof points (Noodles, Chili's, Whataburger) may be used in sales presentations and marketing materials with attribution.
- Anonymized proof points may be used freely without requiring customer approval.
- All metrics should be presented with appropriate context (location count, segment, timeframe).
- When presenting ROI calculations, always specify the assumptions (e.g., average revenue per unit, cost-to-replace figures).
- Fuego metrics should always be paired with the compliance-aware messaging to differentiate from non-compliant EWA providers.
