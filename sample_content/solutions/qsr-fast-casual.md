# Fourth for QSR & Fast Casual

## Overview

Quick-service and fast-casual restaurants operate on razor-thin margins where every minute of labor and every ounce of ingredient counts. With annual crew turnover exceeding **200%** and labor budgets consuming **25-30% of revenue**, QSR operators need technology that moves as fast as their drive-thru lines. Fourth delivers a purpose-built workforce and inventory management platform that helps QSR and fast-casual brands hire faster, schedule smarter, control food costs, and retain the hourly workers who keep the business running.

From single-unit operators to national chains with thousands of locations, Fourth powers the back-of-house operations that make speed of service possible.

## The QSR Challenge

Quick-service and fast-casual brands face a unique combination of operational pressures that general-purpose software cannot address:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **200%+ annual turnover** | Constant hiring cycle; managers spend 20+ hours/week recruiting |
| **15-minute demand spikes** | Understaffing during peak windows kills speed of service and revenue |
| **Tight labor budgets (25-30%)** | Every unproductive labor hour erodes already thin margins |
| **Multi-unit consistency** | Maintaining brand standards across hundreds of locations |
| **Food cost variability** | Waste, portioning errors, and supply chain shifts eat into profitability |
| **Compliance complexity** | Predictive scheduling laws in major metros add administrative burden |

These challenges compound at scale. A 500-location QSR brand losing just $200/week per location in avoidable labor overspend bleeds **$5.2 million annually**.

## How Fourth Solves It

### MacromatiX: Food Cost Control and Waste Tracking

MacromatiX gives QSR operators real-time visibility into food costs at every location. The platform tracks theoretical vs. actual food cost, flags waste and portioning variances, and connects inventory usage directly to POS sales data. Managers see exactly where product is going and where margin is leaking.

- **Automated inventory counts** reduce back-of-house counting time by up to 75%
- **Speed-of-service metrics** correlate staffing levels with drive-thru and counter throughput
- **Waste tracking dashboards** surface patterns across locations so district managers can coach targeted improvements
- **Vendor price management** alerts operators to supply cost increases before they impact P&L

### HotSchedules: High-Volume Shift Management

HotSchedules is the scheduling backbone for QSR operations. The platform handles the complexity of high-volume shift management -- split shifts, minors' labor law restrictions, overtime avoidance, and availability preferences -- while giving managers a schedule they can build in minutes rather than hours.

- **Auto-scheduling** generates optimized schedules aligned to forecasted demand by 15-minute intervals
- **Shift marketplace** lets crew members pick up, swap, or drop shifts from their phones, reducing no-shows by **30%**
- **Labor budget guardrails** alert managers before a schedule exceeds target labor percentage
- **Peak-hour optimization** ensures the right number of crew during lunch rush and dinner windows

### Fourth iQ: 15-Minute Demand Forecasting

Fourth iQ uses AI to forecast customer demand in 15-minute increments, aligned to drive-thru traffic, counter orders, and delivery volume. This granular forecasting feeds directly into HotSchedules so staffing levels match actual demand patterns -- not last year's averages.

- **Weather, events, and local factors** are incorporated into demand models automatically
- **Drive-thru and counter traffic** patterns are learned and predicted separately
- **Forecasts improve over time** as the model ingests more location-specific data
- **Managers receive actionable alerts** when predicted demand diverges from scheduled labor

### PeopleMatter: Volume Hiring Pipeline

With turnover above 200%, QSR brands are always hiring. PeopleMatter streamlines the entire hiring funnel from application to first shift, reducing time-to-hire and giving managers a steady pipeline of qualified candidates.

- **3-minute mobile application** removes friction for hourly job seekers
- **Automated screening** filters candidates based on availability, certifications, and location
- **Digital onboarding** eliminates paper-based I-9s and policy acknowledgments
- **Applicant tracking** gives district and regional managers visibility into hiring velocity across locations

### Fuego: Earned Wage Access for Retention

Fuego gives crew members access to wages they have already earned before payday -- a benefit that directly addresses one of the top reasons hourly workers leave. Operators who deploy Fuego see measurable improvements in retention and shift attendance.

- **40% reduction in turnover** among Fuego users vs. non-users at the same locations
- **Zero cost to the employer** -- the program is funded through small transaction fees paid by employees
- **Same-day access** to earned wages via a mobile app
- **Integrated with Fourth Payroll** for seamless reconciliation
