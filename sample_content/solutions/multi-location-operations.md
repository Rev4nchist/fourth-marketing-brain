# Fourth for Multi-Location Operations

## Overview

Operating a single restaurant is complex. Operating 100, 500, or 5,000 locations across multiple states, municipalities, and sometimes brands introduces a category of challenges that unit-level tools were never designed to handle. Regional compliance variation means a scheduling practice that is legal in Texas violates the law in San Francisco. Above-store visibility gaps mean district managers discover labor cost overruns weeks after they happen. Brand standard inconsistency means the same concept delivers different guest experiences depending on which location a customer visits.

Fourth is the above-store operations platform built for multi-location scale. The platform manages scheduling, compliance, inventory, hiring, payroll, and analytics across **20,000+ locations** and processes payroll for **400,000+ employees monthly**. From corporate-defined templates with local flexibility to location-specific compliance rule sets that enforce dozens of different municipal ordinances simultaneously, Fourth gives multi-location operators the centralized control and localized execution they need to operate consistently at scale.

## The Multi-Location Challenge

The operational challenges of multi-location hospitality grow exponentially, not linearly, with each new unit:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Regional compliance variation** | San Francisco, NYC, Oregon, Chicago, Seattle, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles each have different predictive scheduling laws |
| **Above-store visibility gaps** | District and regional managers lack real-time labor and cost data across their portfolios |
| **Brand standard inconsistency** | Without centralized templates, each location develops its own scheduling and operational practices |
| **Multi-brand complexity** | Operators managing 3-5 brands need a single platform that supports different operational models |
| **Manager turnover at unit level** | New managers inherit no institutional knowledge about scheduling patterns and compliance requirements |
| **Scale economics** | A 1% labor overspend across 1,000 locations represents millions in annual margin erosion |

A multi-location operator with 500 units spending just **1% over optimal labor** loses approximately **$3-5 million annually** -- margin that goes directly to the bottom line when recovered.

## How Fourth Solves It

### Centralized Templates with Local Flexibility

Fourth enables corporate operations teams to define scheduling templates, labor targets, and operational standards that propagate to every location -- while preserving the local flexibility managers need to respond to their specific market conditions.

- **Corporate schedule templates** define shift structures, role ratios, and staffing curves that align with brand standards
- **Labor budget targets** are set at the corporate or regional level and enforced through real-time alerts at the unit level
- **Local manager flexibility** allows unit managers to adjust schedules within defined guardrails (e.g., +/- 5% from template)
- **Template inheritance** means new locations open with proven scheduling patterns on day one, reducing ramp-up time
- **Version-controlled updates** allow corporate teams to push template changes across all locations simultaneously

### Roll-Up Analytics: District, Region, and Brand Dashboards

Fourth Analytics delivers the above-store visibility that multi-location operators need to identify problems early and scale best practices across the organization.

- **District-level dashboards** give area managers real-time visibility into labor cost, schedule adherence, and compliance status across their portfolio
- **Regional roll-ups** aggregate data for regional VPs to compare district performance and allocate resources
- **Brand-level analytics** allow multi-brand operators to benchmark operational metrics across concepts
- **Exception-based management** surfaces only the locations that need attention, so above-store leaders focus on problems rather than monitoring everything
- **Custom KPI tracking** supports operator-defined metrics alongside standard hospitality benchmarks
- **Scheduled reporting** delivers daily, weekly, and period-end reports to the right stakeholders automatically

### Compliance Engine: Location-Specific Rule Sets

Fourth's Compliance Engine is the only hospitality-focused compliance platform that manages dozens of different municipal, state, and federal labor regulations simultaneously across a multi-location portfolio.

- **San Francisco Fair Workweek** -- 14-day advance notice, predictability pay, right to rest between shifts
- **NYC Fair Workweek** -- 72-hour advance notice for fast food, premium pay for schedule changes, access to hours for existing employees
- **Oregon predictive scheduling** -- 14-day advance notice, right to rest, right to input, good faith estimate of hours
- **Chicago Fair Workweek** -- 14-day advance notice, predictability pay, right to decline previously unscheduled hours
- **Seattle Secure Scheduling** -- 14-day advance notice, access to hours, schedule change premium pay
- **Philadelphia Fair Workweek** -- 10-day advance notice, good faith estimate, premium pay for changes
- **Los Angeles Fair Work Week** -- 14-day advance notice, right to rest, predictability pay

Each location in the portfolio automatically receives the correct rule set based on its jurisdiction. When new ordinances pass or existing rules change, Fourth updates the compliance library centrally.

### Fourth iQ: Cross-Location Benchmarking

Fourth iQ applies AI and machine learning across the entire multi-location dataset to identify patterns, surface best practices, and predict operational issues before they impact the business.

- **Cross-location benchmarking** compares labor efficiency, food cost, turnover, and speed of service across peer locations
- **Best practice identification** analyzes top-performing locations to identify the scheduling patterns, staffing models, and operational practices that drive their results
- **Predictive alerts** flag locations trending toward labor budget overruns or compliance violations before they occur
- **Demand forecasting at scale** generates location-specific forecasts that account for local factors, weather, events, and seasonal patterns
- **Portfolio-level insights** surface systemic issues (e.g., a region-wide turnover spike) that location-level analysis would miss

### Brand Consistency: LogBook and Standardized SOPs

Fourth LogBook digitizes shift-to-shift communication and standardizes operating procedures across every location, ensuring brand standards are executed consistently regardless of manager turnover or location.

- **Digital manager logs** replace paper-based shift logs with structured, searchable entries
- **Standardized task checklists** ensure opening, closing, and shift-change procedures follow brand standards
- **Issue escalation** routes operational problems to the appropriate above-store leader automatically
- **Compliance documentation** creates an auditable record of food safety checks, equipment inspections, and shift handoffs
- **New manager onboarding** -- incoming managers inherit the operational history and procedures for their location immediately

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does Fourth handle operators who run multiple brands with different operational models?**
A: Fourth supports multi-brand configurations where each brand maintains its own scheduling templates, labor targets, compliance rules, and operational procedures while sharing a common analytics and reporting infrastructure. A multi-brand operator can define distinct shift structures for a QSR concept and a casual dining concept, apply different labor budget targets, and benchmark each brand independently -- all within a single platform instance. Above-store leaders get portfolio-level visibility across all brands, while brand-level operations teams manage their concepts independently.

**Q: What happens when a new predictive scheduling law passes in one of our markets?**
A: Fourth's compliance team monitors labor legislation across all U.S. jurisdictions continuously. When a new ordinance passes, the compliance library is updated centrally and the new rules automatically apply to all locations in the affected jurisdiction. Operators receive advance notification of upcoming regulatory changes with guidance on operational impact. Existing schedules are validated against the new rules, and managers receive alerts if any published schedules would violate the incoming requirements. This process typically completes **30-60 days before the effective date** of new legislation.

**Q: Can we start with scheduling and add other Fourth modules over time?**
A: Yes. Most multi-location operators begin with HotSchedules for scheduling and labor management, then expand to additional modules based on their priorities. Common expansion paths include adding Fourth Payroll to eliminate payroll integration complexity, deploying MacromatiX for food cost management, implementing PeopleMatter for hiring, and activating Fourth iQ for AI-powered analytics. Each module integrates natively with the others, so data flows automatically without middleware or manual reconciliation. The modular approach allows operators to realize value quickly while building toward a comprehensive workforce management platform.
