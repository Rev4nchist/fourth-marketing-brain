# Fourth for Hotels & Leisure

## Overview

Hotels, resorts, and leisure venues operate workforce environments that are fundamentally different from restaurants. Multiple departments with distinct labor rules, seasonal demand swings that can double staffing requirements overnight, cross-property workforce sharing, and union contract enforcement create a level of scheduling and compliance complexity that restaurant-focused tools cannot address. When a 500-room resort manages food and beverage, housekeeping, front desk, spa, maintenance, and banquet operations under one roof -- each with its own staffing model -- the workforce management platform must be as sophisticated as the operation itself.

Fourth delivers multi-department scheduling, cross-property visibility, union rule compliance, and revenue-linked analytics designed for the hotel, resort, and leisure industry. The platform connects labor decisions directly to occupancy, RevPAR, and event demand so operators staff for profitability, not just coverage.

## The Hotels & Leisure Challenge

Hotel and leisure operators manage a uniquely fragmented workforce across departments that often function as independent businesses:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Multi-department complexity** | F&B, housekeeping, front desk, spa, banquet, and maintenance each have different scheduling rules |
| **Seasonal demand spikes** | Resorts may need 2-3x staff during peak season, with hiring and ramp-up lead times |
| **Cross-property scheduling** | Hotel groups need floating staff pools across properties in the same market |
| **Union environments** | Seniority rules, bid shifts, guaranteed hours, and grievance-triggering scheduling errors |
| **Revenue-labor disconnect** | Staffing decisions made without visibility into occupancy forecasts and event bookings |
| **Event-driven demand** | Banquet and conference bookings create staffing spikes with short lead times |

A single union grievance from a scheduling error can cost **$5,000-$25,000** in arbitration and back pay. At scale, hotels that cannot enforce union rules consistently face six-figure annual exposure.

## How Fourth Solves It

### Multi-Department Scheduling

Fourth supports department-specific scheduling rules within a single property, so each operational area follows its own labor model while management retains a unified view of the entire workforce.

- **Department-level rule sets** define distinct scheduling parameters for kitchen, F&B, housekeeping, front desk, spa, banquet, and maintenance
- **Role-based qualifications** ensure only certified or trained staff are scheduled for specific positions (e.g., lifeguard certification, food handler permits)
- **Department budgets** are managed independently with roll-up visibility for property-level and portfolio-level leadership
- **Cross-department scheduling** identifies employees certified for multiple departments and enables flexible deployment during demand spikes
- **Banquet event staffing** connects to event management systems to auto-generate staffing requirements from BEOs (banquet event orders)

### Cross-Property Visibility

Hotel groups operating multiple properties in the same market can share workforce resources through Fourth's cross-property scheduling capabilities.

- **Floating staff pools** allow designated employees to be scheduled across properties based on demand
- **Property-level permissions** ensure local managers control their own schedules while regional managers access cross-property views
- **Labor sharing analytics** track how floating staff are utilized and which properties benefit most from shared resources
- **Centralized skill profiles** maintain employee certifications, training records, and scheduling preferences across all properties
- **Travel and proximity rules** factor commute distance and employee preferences into cross-property assignment decisions

### Union Rule Compliance

Fourth's Compliance Engine enforces union contract provisions in scheduling decisions, preventing the errors that trigger grievances and arbitration.

- **Seniority-based scheduling** ensures shift assignments follow contractual seniority rules automatically
- **Bid shift management** supports the bid process for desirable shifts and vacation periods per union contract terms
- **Guaranteed hours enforcement** tracks minimum hour commitments and flags schedules that fall below contractual guarantees
- **Overtime equalization** distributes overtime opportunities fairly across eligible employees per union agreement
- **Rest period and consecutive day rules** prevent scheduling violations that commonly trigger grievances
- **Audit trail** documents every scheduling decision for grievance defense

### Revenue-Linked Analytics

Fourth connects labor cost data directly to the revenue metrics that drive hotel profitability, giving operators visibility that pure workforce tools cannot provide.

- **RevPAR vs. labor cost correlation** shows how staffing levels relate to revenue per available room across time periods
- **Occupancy-based forecasting** uses reservation data to predict staffing requirements by department
- **Event-driven demand modeling** factors conference bookings, banquet events, and group arrivals into labor forecasts
- **Housekeeping productivity metrics** track rooms cleaned per labor hour with quality score integration
- **F&B labor efficiency** measures covers served, revenue generated, and labor cost per outlet
- **Seasonal trend analysis** surfaces year-over-year patterns so operators can plan hiring and training cycles proactively

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can Fourth handle union contracts that vary by property and department?**
A: Yes. Fourth's Compliance Engine supports unlimited union contract configurations, each with its own seniority rules, bid shift processes, guaranteed hour minimums, overtime distribution requirements, and rest period regulations. Contracts can be configured at the property level, department level, or job classification level. When contract terms are renegotiated, rule updates are made centrally and apply immediately to all affected scheduling decisions.

**Q: How does Fourth integrate with hotel PMS and event management systems?**
A: Fourth integrates with major property management systems including Oracle Opera, Amadeus HotSOS, and Infor HMS to pull occupancy data, reservation forecasts, and arrival/departure patterns into labor demand models. For event-driven properties, Fourth connects to banquet event order systems to automatically generate staffing requirements from confirmed events. These integrations ensure labor forecasts reflect actual demand signals rather than historical averages.

**Q: Is Fourth suitable for properties with a mix of full-time, part-time, and seasonal workers?**
A: Fourth is designed for exactly this workforce composition. The platform manages full-time employees with guaranteed hours and benefits eligibility, part-time staff with availability-based scheduling, and seasonal workers with rapid onboarding through PeopleMatter. ACA compliance tracking monitors hours for benefits eligibility thresholds, and the system flags employees approaching full-time status so operators can make informed staffing decisions.
