# Fourth for Casual Dining & Full Service

## Overview

Casual dining and full-service restaurants face a level of workforce complexity that quick-service brands rarely encounter. Tipped employees, split shifts, server section rotations, tip pooling regulations, and seasonal staffing swings create an operational environment where scheduling errors do not just cost money -- they create compliance exposure. With labor consuming **30-35% of revenue** and tip-related wage claims among the fastest-growing categories of hospitality litigation, casual dining operators need a platform built for the nuances of full-service restaurant management.

Fourth provides the scheduling, compliance, payroll, and analytics tools that casual dining brands rely on to manage tipped workforces at scale, control labor costs by daypart, and stay ahead of an increasingly complex regulatory landscape.

## The Casual Dining Challenge

Full-service restaurants manage a fundamentally different workforce than QSR. Servers, bartenders, bussers, hosts, and kitchen staff each have distinct scheduling needs, pay structures, and compliance requirements:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Tip compliance complexity** | Tip pooling, tip credit, and reporting rules vary by state and municipality |
| **Split shift premiums** | California and other states require premium pay for split shifts -- easy to miss |
| **Server scheduling preferences** | Section assignments, shift preferences, and seniority expectations affect retention |
| **Seasonal staffing swings** | Patio season, holidays, and local events create demand spikes that are hard to staff |
| **Higher labor costs (30-35%)** | Full-service labor intensity means scheduling precision has outsized P&L impact |
| **Daypart profitability variation** | Lunch may lose money while dinner drives profit -- but only with the right staffing |

A single tip compliance violation can trigger Department of Labor audits that cost a multi-unit casual dining brand **$500,000 or more** in back wages and penalties.

## How Fourth Solves It

### Compliance Engine: Tip and Wage Law Automation

Fourth's Compliance Engine is purpose-built for the tipped employee environment that defines casual dining. The platform automates tip pooling calculations, tip credit applications, predictive scheduling compliance, and split shift premium tracking -- removing the manual processes where costly errors occur.

- **Tip pooling rules** configured by role, location, and jurisdiction with automatic distribution calculations
- **Tip credit compliance** ensures tipped minimum wage plus tips meets or exceeds the applicable minimum wage, flagging shortfalls before they become violations
- **Predictive scheduling enforcement** handles advance notice requirements, right-to-rest rules, and schedule change premiums in cities like San Francisco, New York, and Chicago
- **Split shift tracking** automatically identifies split shifts and calculates required premiums under California, New York, and other state laws
- **Audit-ready records** maintain a complete compliance trail for every scheduling and pay decision

### HotSchedules: Server-Centric Scheduling

HotSchedules understands that scheduling in a full-service restaurant is about more than filling shifts. Server section assignments, bartender rotations, host stand coverage, and kitchen line staffing each follow different rules. HotSchedules handles this complexity while giving managers a schedule they can publish in minutes.

- **Section-based scheduling** assigns servers to specific dining room sections with covers-per-server targets
- **Availability and preference management** lets staff submit availability, preferred sections, and shift preferences from their phones
- **Seniority-based priority** supports seniority rules for shift selection and section assignments
- **Shift marketplace** enables server-to-server shift swaps with manager approval, reducing call-outs
- **Cross-training visibility** identifies staff certified for multiple roles to maximize scheduling flexibility

### Fourth Payroll: Hospitality-Specific Calculations

Generic payroll systems struggle with the complexity of tipped employee pay. Fourth Payroll is built for casual dining, handling tip credit calculations, split shift premiums, tip reporting, and multi-rate pay in a single integrated system.

- **Automatic tip credit calculations** by shift, day, and pay period with shortfall alerts
- **Multi-rate pay processing** for employees who work both tipped and non-tipped roles in the same period
- **Split shift premium automation** eliminates manual calculations and ensures compliance
- **Tip reporting (Form 8027)** generated automatically for qualifying large food and beverage establishments
- **Direct integration with HotSchedules** ensures scheduled hours, actual hours, and pay calculations are always aligned

### Analytics: Per-Cover Labor Cost and Daypart Profitability

Fourth Analytics gives casual dining operators the visibility they need to optimize labor spending at the level that matters -- per cover, per daypart, per location. Generic dashboards show total labor cost. Fourth shows where that labor is actually producing revenue.

- **Per-cover labor cost** tracks labor efficiency relative to guest volume, not just clock hours
- **Daypart profitability analysis** identifies which meal periods are profitable and which are subsidized
- **Server productivity metrics** correlate individual server performance with covers served and average check
- **Comparative benchmarking** across locations highlights top and bottom performers for targeted coaching
- **Trend analysis** surfaces seasonal patterns so managers can adjust staffing plans proactively

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does Fourth handle tip pooling across different state and local regulations?**
A: Fourth's Compliance Engine maintains a continuously updated library of tip pooling regulations by jurisdiction. Operators configure their tip pool structure once -- defining eligible roles, distribution percentages, and applicable rules -- and the system automatically calculates distributions for every shift. When regulations change (as they frequently do at the state and local level), Fourth updates the rule library so operators stay compliant without manual intervention. The platform supports both traditional tip pools and newer tip-sharing arrangements permitted under the 2018 FLSA amendments.

**Q: Can Fourth schedule servers by section and manage seniority preferences?**
A: Yes. HotSchedules supports section-based scheduling natively, allowing managers to assign servers to specific dining room sections with target covers-per-server ratios. The platform also supports seniority-based scheduling preferences, where more tenured servers receive priority in shift and section selection. Staff submit their availability and preferences through the HotSchedules mobile app, and the auto-scheduling engine factors these inputs alongside labor budget targets and forecasted demand to produce optimized schedules.

**Q: What makes Fourth Payroll different from standard payroll providers for casual dining?**
A: Fourth Payroll was designed specifically for hospitality pay complexity. Unlike generic payroll systems that bolt on tip handling as an afterthought, Fourth Payroll natively processes tip credit calculations, multi-rate pay for employees working both tipped and non-tipped roles, split shift premiums, and IRS Form 8027 tip reporting. Because it integrates directly with HotSchedules, scheduled hours and actual hours are always reconciled -- eliminating the data gaps that cause payroll errors and compliance exposure in casual dining operations.
