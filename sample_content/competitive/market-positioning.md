# Fourth Competitive Positioning

## Market Landscape

The workforce management (WFM) market for restaurants and hospitality is served by three categories of vendors:

1. **Generic HCM Platforms** - Workday, ADP, UKG, Ceridian
2. **Hospitality Point Solutions** - 7shifts, Deputy, Homebase, When I Work
3. **Restaurant Tech Platforms** - Restaurant365, MarginEdge, Crunchtime

Fourth occupies a unique position: **purpose-built for hospitality with enterprise scalability**.

## Competitive Matrix

### vs. Generic HCM (Workday, ADP, UKG)

| Dimension | Fourth | Generic HCM |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Industry focus | Hospitality-specific | Horizontal, all industries |
| Tip management | Native, automated | Manual or bolt-on |
| Demand forecasting | AI, POS-integrated | Generic or none |
| Scheduling complexity | Split shifts, clopening, minors | Basic shift scheduling |
| Implementation time | 8-12 weeks | 6-18 months |
| Total cost of ownership | Lower (fewer customizations needed) | Higher (extensive config required) |
| Compliance rules | 500+ hospitality-specific | Generic labor law |
| Mobile experience | Purpose-built for hourly workers | Repurposed from salaried workflows |

**Talk track:** "Generic HCM platforms are built for salaried office workers and retrofitted for hourly. Fourth is built from the ground up for the unique needs of hospitality - tip calculations, split shifts, minor labor laws, predictive scheduling ordinances. This means faster implementation, lower TCO, and better adoption by your managers and team members."

### vs. Point Solutions (7shifts, Deputy, Homebase)

| Dimension | Fourth | Point Solutions |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Scope | Full platform (hire to retire) | Scheduling only (or scheduling + basic time) |
| Scale | 50 to 5,000+ locations | Typically <100 locations |
| Payroll | Included (Enterprise) | Not offered |
| Demand forecasting | AI-powered | Basic or none |
| Applicant tracking | Included | Not offered |
| Enterprise features | SSO, RBAC, audit trail, API | Limited |
| Integrations | 200+ pre-built | 10-30 |
| Compliance depth | All 50 states + municipalities | Major states only |

**Talk track:** "Point solutions like 7shifts work well for small operators, but as you grow past 50 locations, you need enterprise capabilities - SSO, granular RBAC, compliance across multiple jurisdictions, and integration with your entire tech stack. Fourth provides a single platform that replaces 5-7 point solutions."

### vs. Restaurant365

| Dimension | Fourth | Restaurant365 |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Core strength | Workforce management | Accounting & back office |
| Scheduling | AI-optimized, demand-driven | Basic scheduling |
| Payroll | Full-service, hospitality-specific | Partnership/referral |
| Time & Attendance | Full compliance engine | Basic time tracking |
| Accounting | Via integration (Sage, QBO) | Native |
| Inventory | Via integration | Native |
| Overlap | Minimal - complementary | Minimal - complementary |

**Talk track:** "R365 and Fourth are complementary, not competitive. R365 excels at accounting and inventory; Fourth excels at workforce management. Many customers use both, connected via our pre-built integration."

## Win/Loss Themes

### Why We Win
1. **Hospitality expertise** - Deep domain knowledge resonates with operators
2. **Scheduling AI** - Measurable ROI (2-4% labor cost savings)
3. **Compliance depth** - Eliminates legal risk across jurisdictions
4. **Platform breadth** - Single vendor for hire-to-retire
5. **HotSchedules brand** - Industry recognition and trust

### Why We Lose
1. **Price** - Higher than point solutions for small operators (<50 locations)
2. **Bundled approach** - Prospects who only want scheduling may prefer cheaper point solutions
3. **Implementation timeline** - Longer than plug-and-play point solutions
4. **Incumbent HCM** - Large enterprises already invested in Workday/UKG may resist switching WFM

## Key Differentiators for Competitive Deals

1. **The Compliance Argument**: "How confident are you that your current system handles every scheduling ordinance across all your jurisdictions?"
2. **The Integration Argument**: "How many systems do your managers log into daily? Fourth consolidates to one."
3. **The ROI Argument**: "Our customers see 2-4% labor cost reduction within 90 days. At your scale, that's $X million annually."
4. **The Scale Argument**: "We manage scheduling for 20,000+ locations and payroll for 400,000+ employees. We've seen every edge case."
