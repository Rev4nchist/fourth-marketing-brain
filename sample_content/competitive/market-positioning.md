# Fourth Competitive Positioning

## Market Landscape

The workforce management (WFM) market for restaurants and hospitality is served by three categories of vendors:

1. **Generic HCM Platforms** - Workday, ADP, UKG, Ceridian
2. **Hospitality Point Solutions** - 7shifts, Deputy, Homebase, When I Work, Sling
3. **Restaurant Tech Platforms** - Restaurant365, MarginEdge, Crunchtime

Fourth occupies a unique position: **purpose-built for hospitality with enterprise scalability**. No other vendor combines the depth of hospitality-specific functionality (tips, compliance, demand forecasting) with the breadth of a full platform (hire-to-retire + inventory + analytics).

## The Fourth Differentiation Framework

### 1. Purpose-Built vs. Retrofitted
Fourth is designed from the ground up for hospitality. Generic HCM platforms are designed for salaried office workers and retrofitted for hourly. This matters for:
- **Tip management**: Native tip pooling, tip credit, service charge handling vs. manual/bolt-on
- **Scheduling complexity**: Split shifts, clopening prevention, minor labor laws, section assignments vs. basic shift scheduling
- **Compliance depth**: 500+ hospitality-specific rules vs. generic labor law
- **Mobile experience**: Built for hourly workers who may not have email vs. repurposed from salaried workflows

### 2. Platform vs. Point Solution
Fourth provides the full employee lifecycle (hire-to-retire) plus inventory. Point solutions cover scheduling only (or scheduling + basic time). This matters for:
- **Data continuity**: Single employee record across all modules vs. fragmented data across 5-7 tools
- **Analytics**: Cross-module insights (hiring cost vs. retention, schedule flexibility vs. turnover) vs. siloed reporting
- **Vendor management**: One contract, one support team, one integration vs. managing 5-7 vendor relationships
- **Total cost**: Platform pricing vs. accumulated point solution costs (typically 30-50% higher)

### 3. Enterprise Scale vs. SMB Focus
Fourth serves 50-5,000+ location operators. Point solutions typically serve <100 locations. This matters for:
- **Multi-jurisdiction compliance**: All 50 states + municipalities vs. major states only
- **Enterprise security**: SSO, RBAC, audit trails, SOC 2 Type II vs. limited security features
- **Integration breadth**: 200+ pre-built integrations vs. 10-30
- **Support model**: Dedicated CSM, QBRs, implementation team vs. self-service

## Competitive Matrix

### vs. Generic HCM (Workday, ADP, UKG, Ceridian)

| Dimension | Fourth | Generic HCM |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Industry focus | Hospitality-specific | Horizontal, all industries |
| Tip management | Native, automated | Manual or bolt-on |
| Demand forecasting | AI, POS-integrated (Fourth iQ) | Generic or none |
| Scheduling complexity | Split shifts, clopening, minors, sections | Basic shift scheduling |
| Compliance rules | 500+ hospitality-specific | Generic labor law |
| Implementation time | 8-12 weeks | 6-18 months |
| Total cost of ownership | Lower (fewer customizations needed) | Higher (extensive config required) |
| Mobile experience | Purpose-built for hourly (3M+ users) | Repurposed from salaried workflows |
| Inventory management | Included (MacromatiX) | Not offered |
| Earned wage access | Included (Fuego, $0 cost) | Via third-party integration |

**Talk track:** "Generic HCM platforms are built for salaried office workers and retrofitted for hourly. Fourth is built from the ground up for the unique needs of hospitality - tip calculations, split shifts, minor labor laws, predictive scheduling ordinances. This means faster implementation, lower TCO, and better adoption by your managers and team members."

### vs. Point Solutions (7shifts, Deputy, Homebase, When I Work)

| Dimension | Fourth | Point Solutions |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Scope | Full platform (hire to retire + inventory) | Scheduling only (or scheduling + basic time) |
| Scale | 50 to 5,000+ locations | Typically <100 locations |
| Payroll | Included (Enterprise) | Not offered |
| Demand forecasting | AI-powered (Fourth iQ) | Basic or none |
| Applicant tracking | Included (PeopleMatter) | Not offered |
| Inventory | Included (MacromatiX) | Not offered |
| Earned wage access | Included (Fuego) | Via third-party |
| Enterprise features | SSO, RBAC, audit trail, full API | Limited |
| Integrations | 200+ pre-built | 10-30 |
| Compliance depth | All 50 states + municipalities | Major states only |

**Talk track:** "Point solutions like 7shifts work well for small operators, but as you grow past 50 locations, you need enterprise capabilities - SSO, granular RBAC, compliance across multiple jurisdictions, and integration with your entire tech stack. Fourth provides a single platform that replaces 5-7 point solutions."

### vs. Restaurant365

| Dimension | Fourth | Restaurant365 |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Core strength | Workforce management | Accounting & back office |
| Scheduling | AI-optimized, demand-driven (Fourth iQ) | Basic scheduling (acquired Ctuit) |
| Payroll | Full-service, hospitality-specific | Partnership/referral |
| Time & Attendance | Full compliance engine (500+ rules) | Basic time tracking |
| Accounting | Via integration (Sage, QBO, NetSuite) | Native (core strength) |
| Inventory | MacromatiX (full purchase-to-pay) | Native |
| HR/Hiring | PeopleMatter ATS + Onboarding | Basic |
| AI/Forecasting | Fourth iQ (95%+ accuracy) | Basic forecasting |
| Overlap | Inventory, basic reporting | Inventory, basic scheduling |

**Talk track:** "R365 and Fourth are complementary, not competitive. R365 excels at accounting and inventory; Fourth excels at workforce management, compliance, and AI-driven scheduling. Many customers use both, connected via our pre-built integration. The question isn't R365 or Fourth - it's which workforce challenges are costing you more."

## Win/Loss Themes

### Why We Win
1. **Hospitality expertise** - Deep domain knowledge resonates with operators who've been burned by generic tools
2. **Scheduling AI (Fourth iQ)** - Measurable ROI (2-4% labor cost savings) within 90 days
3. **Compliance depth** - Eliminates legal risk across jurisdictions (500+ rules)
4. **Platform breadth** - Single vendor for hire-to-retire + inventory (Restaurant Operations Suite)
5. **HotSchedules brand** - Industry recognition, trust, and 3M+ active users
6. **Fuego differentiator** - $0-cost earned wage access with proven 40% turnover reduction

### Why We Lose
1. **Price** - Higher than point solutions for small operators (<50 locations) - mitigate with Essentials tier
2. **Bundled approach** - Prospects who only want scheduling may prefer cheaper point solutions - offer modular entry
3. **Implementation timeline** - Longer than plug-and-play point solutions (8-12 weeks vs. 1-2 weeks) - emphasize ROI speed
4. **Incumbent HCM** - Large enterprises already invested in Workday/UKG may resist switching WFM - position as complement
5. **Accounting gap** - No native accounting (vs. R365) - position partnership/integration story

## Key Differentiators for Competitive Deals

1. **The Compliance Argument**: "How confident are you that your current system handles every scheduling ordinance across all your jurisdictions? One Fair Workweek violation in NYC can cost $500 per occurrence."
2. **The Integration Argument**: "How many systems do your managers log into daily? Fourth consolidates to one. Our customers report 4+ hours/week saved per manager."
3. **The ROI Argument**: "Our customers see 2-4% labor cost reduction within 90 days. At your scale, that's $X million annually."
4. **The Scale Argument**: "We manage scheduling for 20,000+ locations and payroll for 400,000+ employees. We've seen every edge case."
5. **The Retention Argument**: "Fuego earned wage access reduces turnover by 40% at $0 cost to you. At $3,500 per turnover event, the math is compelling."
