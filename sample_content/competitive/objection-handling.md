# Objection Handling Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the 15 most common objections Fourth sales reps encounter during competitive deals. Each objection includes the recommended response framework and a supporting proof point. Use these as starting points -- adapt the language to your prospect's specific context, vertical, and scale.

The structure for each objection: what the prospect says, how to respond, and what evidence backs up the response.

---

## Objection 1: "Fourth is too expensive."

**Objection:** "Your pricing is higher than what we're paying now. We can't justify the cost."

**Response:** Focus on ROI, not price. Fourth customers typically achieve **2-4% labor cost savings** through AI-driven scheduling, compliance automation, and overtime reduction. For a 100-location restaurant brand spending $50M annually on labor, that is $1M-$2M in savings per year. The platform pays for itself within 90 days for most customers. The question is not what Fourth costs -- it is what labor waste costs without it.

**Proof Point:** Fourth customers report an average of 3% reduction in labor costs within the first six months. A national fast-casual chain with 400+ locations documented $4.2M in annual labor savings after deploying Fourth's scheduling and forecasting modules.

## Objection 2: "We already use [competitor]."

**Objection:** "We're already on 7shifts / UKG / ADP / Deputy and it's working fine."

**Response:** Acknowledge what is working. Then probe on what is not. "Working fine" usually means scheduling is covered but compliance, payroll, HR, and forecasting are handled by separate tools or manual processes. The consolidation conversation starts with: "How many systems touch your workforce today? How much time does your team spend moving data between them?" Fourth replaces 3-5 tools with one platform, eliminating sync issues, reducing admin overhead, and creating a single source of truth.

**Proof Point:** Operators who consolidate from 3+ point solutions to Fourth report 15-20 hours per week in saved admin time per district. One QSR brand reduced their technology vendor count from 7 to 3 by adopting Fourth for all workforce functions.

---

## Objection 3: "We're too small for Fourth."

**Objection:** "Fourth seems like an enterprise product. We only have 15 locations."

**Response:** Fourth serves operators from 10 locations to 5,000+. The **Essentials package** is designed specifically for growing brands in the 10-100 location range. It includes scheduling, labor management, and compliance without the complexity of the full enterprise suite. More importantly, Fourth grows with you. Starting now means you are not migrating platforms at 50 or 100 locations when the pain of outgrowing a point solution becomes acute.

**Proof Point:** Over 200 Fourth customers started with fewer than 25 locations. Several have grown to 500+ locations on the platform without a migration event.

---

## Objection 4: "Implementation takes too long."

**Objection:** "We can't afford a year-long implementation. We need something live in weeks."

**Response:** Fourth's standard implementation is **8-12 weeks** for scheduling, labor management, and compliance. This is possible because hospitality-specific compliance rules, POS integrations, and workflows are pre-built -- not custom configured. Compare this to generic HCM platforms (UKG, ADP, Ceridian) that typically require 6-18 months because every hospitality rule must be configured from scratch. Fourth also offers a phased approach: go live with scheduling first, then add payroll and HR in subsequent phases.

**Proof Point:** A 300-location casual dining brand went live with Fourth scheduling across all locations in 10 weeks. Full payroll and HR followed in an additional 8 weeks.

---

## Objection 5: "Our managers won't adopt new software."

**Objection:** "We've tried new tools before. Managers ignore them and go back to spreadsheets."

**Response:** HotSchedules -- Fourth's scheduling platform -- has **over 3 million active users** and a 90%+ adoption rate among hourly team members and managers. It is the most widely recognized scheduling app in the restaurant industry. Many of your managers and team members have already used it at a previous employer. The mobile-first design means there is no desktop training required. Managers create schedules on their phone in minutes. Team members manage availability, swap shifts, and view earnings without ever opening a laptop.

**Proof Point:** Fourth's average manager adoption rate reaches 90% within 30 days of go-live. The HotSchedules brand has over 15 years of user trust in the restaurant industry.

---

## Objection 6: "We need accounting, not just labor."

**Objection:** "Our biggest pain is AP/AR and financial reporting. Fourth doesn't do accounting."

**Response:** Correct -- Fourth does not replace your accounting system, and we do not try to. Fourth integrates natively with **Restaurant365, QuickBooks, Sage, NetSuite**, and other accounting platforms. The strongest back-office operations use best-of-breed: Fourth for workforce, R365 or your preferred platform for accounting. Labor data flows automatically from Fourth into your accounting system, giving your finance team accurate labor costs without manual data entry.

**Proof Point:** Over 40% of Fourth's enterprise customers also use Restaurant365 for accounting. The native integration synchronizes labor costs, payroll data, and headcount daily.

---

## Objection 7: "We're locked into a contract with [X]."

**Objection:** "We signed a 3-year deal with our current vendor. We can't switch."

**Response:** Understood. Two paths forward. First, **phased migration**: start with a Fourth module that does not overlap with your current contract (for example, add Fourth scheduling while keeping your existing payroll until the contract ends). Second, **ROI justification for early termination**: if Fourth's labor savings exceed the remaining contract obligation -- which they often do within 6-12 months -- the math supports an early switch. We can build that ROI model together.

**Proof Point:** A 150-location brand paid an early termination fee to exit their UKG contract 14 months early. Fourth's labor savings recovered the termination cost within 5 months.

---

## Objection 8: "Just need scheduling, nothing else."

**Objection:** "We only want scheduling. We don't need payroll, HR, or all the other stuff."

**Response:** Start with scheduling. Fourth's modular architecture means you deploy what you need today and expand when you are ready. Most customers start with scheduling and labor management, then add compliance, payroll, or HR as they grow. The advantage of choosing Fourth for scheduling -- even if that is all you need now -- is that you avoid a migration event later when you do need payroll or compliance. The data, the integrations, and the team member profiles are already in place.

**Proof Point:** 60% of Fourth customers who started with scheduling-only expanded to at least two additional modules within 18 months. The most common expansion path is scheduling to scheduling + compliance to scheduling + compliance + payroll.

---

## Objection 9: "What about data migration?"

**Objection:** "We have years of data in our current system. Migration sounds like a nightmare."

**Response:** Fourth has a **dedicated data migration team** that has executed hundreds of migrations from every major platform (UKG, ADP, 7shifts, Deputy, Kronos, Ceridian, and custom systems). The process is structured: extract, validate, transform, load, and verify. We achieve **99.5% data accuracy** on migration and run parallel validation with your team before cutover. Employee records, historical schedules, pay history, and compliance documents are all migrated.

**Proof Point:** Fourth has completed 500+ data migrations with a 99.5% accuracy rate. The average migration adds 2-3 weeks to the implementation timeline, not months.

---

## Objection 10: "Is my data secure?"

**Objection:** "We handle sensitive employee data -- SSNs, bank accounts, health info. How secure is Fourth?"

**Response:** Fourth maintains **SOC 2 Type II certification**, **PCI DSS compliance**, and encrypts all data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+). Role-based access control ensures employees only see data relevant to their role. Fourth conducts annual penetration testing, maintains a formal incident response plan, and supports single sign-on (SAML/OIDC) for enterprise customers. Data residency options are available for customers with geographic requirements.

**Proof Point:** Fourth has maintained SOC 2 Type II certification continuously since 2019. Zero material data breaches in company history. Regular third-party security audits by independent firms.

---

## Objection 11: "We have union employees."

**Objection:** "Our workforce is unionized. Can Fourth handle union rules?"

**Response:** Yes. Fourth's compliance engine supports **union rule enforcement** including seniority-based scheduling, guaranteed minimum hours, shift bidding, overtime distribution rules, grievance-eligible schedule changes, and union-specific break rules. These rules are configured per collective bargaining agreement and enforced automatically at the point of scheduling. Managers cannot accidentally violate union rules because the system prevents non-compliant schedules from being published.

**Proof Point:** Fourth supports unionized workforces at several major hotel and casino brands, including properties with 5+ different collective bargaining agreements operating simultaneously.

---

## Objection 12: "We operate internationally."

**Objection:** "We have locations in the US and UK (or Canada, or other markets). Can Fourth support that?"

**Response:** Fourth operates in both the **United States and United Kingdom** with full localization: currency, tax rules, labor law compliance, and language. Fourth is **GDPR compliant** for UK and European operations. For US + UK operators, Fourth provides a single platform with location-specific compliance rules, eliminating the need for separate workforce systems per country. Canadian support is available through partner integrations.

**Proof Point:** Fourth powers workforce operations for several global hospitality brands operating across the US and UK, including hotel groups and restaurant chains with 1,000+ locations combined.

---

## Objection 13: "AI scheduling sounds risky."

**Objection:** "We're not comfortable letting an algorithm decide our staffing."

**Response:** Fourth's AI is **human-in-the-loop**. The system generates schedule recommendations based on demand forecasting, compliance rules, employee availability, and labor budgets. **The manager always reviews and approves the final schedule.** AI handles the math -- analyzing historical sales, weather, events, and 500+ compliance rules simultaneously -- while the manager applies judgment and local knowledge. Think of it as a scheduling assistant that does 90% of the work, not an autopilot that removes human control.

**Proof Point:** Fourth's AI-recommended schedules are accepted by managers with an average of only 12% manual adjustments. Managers report saving 3-5 hours per week on scheduling while maintaining full control over the final published schedule.

---

## Objection 14: "Our POS isn't on your integration list."

**Objection:** "We use [niche POS system] and I don't see it on your supported integrations page."

**Response:** Fourth integrates with **all major POS systems** and has an **Integration Hub** for custom connections. If your POS is not on the pre-built list, Fourth's integration team can build a custom connector. Most custom POS integrations are completed within **4-6 weeks** as part of implementation. The Integration Hub supports flat file, API, and webhook-based data transfer, so even legacy POS systems can connect.

**Proof Point:** Fourth has built custom POS integrations for over 30 regional and niche POS systems beyond the 50+ pre-built connectors. The custom integration process is included in standard implementation -- no additional cost for the first custom connector.

---

## Objection 15: "We just signed with [competitor]."

**Objection:** "We literally just signed a deal with 7shifts / Deputy / UKG last month. Bad timing."

**Response:** No problem. This is not a "now or never" conversation. Let us stay in touch and establish the relationship for when you are ready to expand or when the contract is up for renewal. In the meantime, we can: (1) run a complimentary **labor cost analysis** so you have a baseline for comparison, (2) share industry benchmarks for your segment, and (3) keep you updated on Fourth product releases. When renewal time comes, you will have the data to make an informed decision.

**Proof Point:** 35% of Fourth's enterprise wins come from prospects who evaluated Fourth 12-24 months before signing. Maintaining the relationship through the competitor's contract period is a proven pipeline strategy.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Never lead with price. Lead with ROI.** The 2-4% labor savings argument reframes every pricing conversation.
2. **Acknowledge competitors honestly.** Credibility comes from recognizing what others do well, then redirecting to Fourth's strengths.
3. **Probe on pain, not features.** "How many systems touch your workforce?" opens more doors than a feature comparison.
4. **Compliance is the sharpest differentiator.** 500+ rules across 200+ municipalities is a factual advantage that is difficult for any competitor to match.
5. **Always leave the door open.** "Just signed with someone" is a timing objection, not a rejection. Stay in the relationship.
