# Fourth vs. Restaurant365: Competitive Battle Card

## Overview

Fourth and Restaurant365 approach the restaurant technology stack from opposite directions. **Fourth is workforce-first** -- scheduling, labor optimization, HR, and payroll built specifically for hospitality. **Restaurant365 is accounting-first** -- AP/AR, general ledger, P&L reporting, and bank reconciliation designed for multi-unit operators. They overlap in inventory management and reporting, but the core value propositions are distinct and often complementary. Many enterprise operators run both platforms side by side.

This battle card helps sales reps position Fourth accurately when R365 comes up in conversation, whether as a competitor or a complement.

## Positioning: Complement vs. Compete

**The "Both-And" Story (Most Common)**

In most enterprise deals, Fourth and R365 are complementary. Fourth owns the workforce side (scheduling, labor, HR, payroll), and R365 owns the financial side (accounting, AP/AR, P&L). Data flows between them through a native integration. This is the strongest positioning when a prospect already uses R365 or is evaluating both.

> "R365 is a strong accounting platform. We integrate with them natively. Think of it this way: R365 tells you what you spent. Fourth helps you control what you spend before it hits the P&L -- through smarter scheduling, labor compliance, and demand-based staffing."

**When Fourth Competes Directly**

Fourth competes with R365 when the prospect's primary pain is labor cost, compliance risk, or workforce complexity -- and R365 is being positioned as a "full platform" that covers scheduling and HR.

> "R365 added scheduling and HR modules, but their DNA is accounting. Our DNA is workforce management for hospitality. That difference shows up in compliance depth, mobile adoption, AI forecasting, and scale. Ask them how many predictive scheduling rules they enforce, or how their tip pooling handles multi-rate calculations."

## Talk Track: When a Prospect Mentions R365

**Discovery Questions:**

- "What are you using R365 for today -- primarily accounting, or are you also relying on it for scheduling and labor?"
- "How are you handling labor compliance across your markets? Is that automated or manual?"
- "What does your hourly team member experience look like on mobile today?"

**Pivot Points:**

- If they use R365 for accounting only: Position Fourth as the workforce complement. Highlight the native integration.
- If they use R365 for scheduling: Probe on compliance gaps, mobile adoption, and forecasting accuracy. These are Fourth's strongest differentiators.
- If they are evaluating R365 as a full platform: Emphasize that best-of-breed outperforms suite in workforce management. Reference the integration story.

## When Fourth Wins

- **Workforce complexity is the primary pain.** Multi-state compliance, union rules, minor labor, tip management, high-volume scheduling.
- **Scale above 200 locations.** Fourth's enterprise architecture, global support, and proven deployments at 5,000+ locations.
- **Mobile adoption matters.** HotSchedules has 3M+ active users. Hourly workers already know it.
- **AI-driven labor optimization.** Demand forecasting integrated with scheduling to hit labor cost targets.

## When R365 Wins

- **Accounting is the primary pain.** AP automation, GL management, multi-entity financial consolidation.
- **P&L reporting is the top priority.** R365's financial reporting suite is deeper than Fourth's.
- **Mid-market operators (5-100 locations)** who want one vendor for accounting + basic scheduling and don't have complex compliance needs.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Fourth and R365 are complementary more often than competitive.** Lead with the "both-and" story.
2. **When competing, win on workforce depth:** compliance, AI forecasting, mobile, payroll, scale.
3. **Never disparage R365's accounting.** It is genuinely strong. Acknowledge it and redirect to workforce.
4. **Ask about compliance and mobile.** These are the two areas where the gap is widest.
5. **Reference the native integration.** It removes the "do I have to choose?" objection entirely.
