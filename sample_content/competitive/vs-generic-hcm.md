# Fourth vs. Generic HCM: Battle Card (UKG, ADP, Ceridian)

## Overview

Generic HCM platforms -- UKG Pro/Ready, ADP Workforce Now, Ceridian Dayforce, and Workday -- were built for salaried, office-based workforces and later adapted for hourly employees. **Fourth was built from day one for hospitality's unique workforce challenges:** tip management, demand-driven scheduling, predictive compliance, minor labor rules, and a mobile experience designed for team members who never sit at a desk.

The core argument is simple: **purpose-built beats repurposed.** A platform designed for hospitality outperforms a generic platform customized for hospitality -- in functionality, time to value, total cost of ownership, and user adoption.

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Capability | Fourth | Generic HCM (UKG, ADP, Ceridian) |
|---|---|---|
| **Tip Management** | **Native.** Tip pooling, tip sharing, FICA tip credit, multi-rate tip calculations, tip compliance reporting -- all built into payroll and scheduling. | Bolt-on or manual. Requires third-party integrations or spreadsheet workarounds for tip pooling and multi-rate calculations. |
| **Hospitality Compliance** | **500+ labor law rules** across all 50 states and 200+ municipalities. Predictive scheduling (SF, NYC, Chicago, OR, Seattle, LA, Philadelphia), minor labor (all states), break rules, overtime, clopening protections -- enforced at the point of scheduling. | Generic compliance frameworks. Major federal and state rules covered. Municipal predictive scheduling, minor labor variations, and hospitality-specific rules require custom configuration or are unsupported. |
| **Demand Forecasting** | **POS-integrated AI forecasting.** Uses historical sales, weather, local events, and day-part patterns to predict demand and recommend staffing levels per 15-minute interval. | No demand forecasting tied to POS data. Workforce planning is budget-based, not demand-based. Requires separate BI tools to approximate. |
| **Scheduling** | Built for hospitality complexity: split shifts, rotating schedules, clopening prevention, open shift broadcasting, shift swapping, cross-location scheduling, availability management, labor budget guardrails. | Basic scheduling. Handles standard shifts. Split shifts, clopening rules, and cross-location scheduling require custom configuration or are unavailable. |
| **Mobile Experience** | **Built for hourly workers.** HotSchedules has 3M+ active users. Schedule viewing, shift swap, availability, messaging, earnings, onboarding -- all mobile-first. 90%+ adoption rates typical. | Repurposed from salaried workforce apps. Mobile exists but was designed for managers and office workers. Hourly adoption rates typically 40-60%. |
| **Implementation** | **8-12 weeks** for most deployments. Hospitality-specific templates, pre-built compliance rules, and POS integrations reduce configuration time. | **6-18 months** for enterprise deployments. Generic platform requires extensive customization for hospitality workflows, compliance rules, and integrations. |
| **POS Integration** | Native integrations with **all major POS systems** (Toast, Aloha, MICROS, Square, Revel, Lightspeed, and 50+ more). Sales data flows directly into forecasting and labor analysis. | Limited POS integration. Typically requires middleware or custom development. Sales data is not used for workforce planning. |
| **Payroll** | Hospitality-native payroll: multi-rate pay, tip calculations, FICA tip credit, multi-state/multi-EIN, tipped minimum wage, and automated tax filing. | Full payroll capability, but tip-specific calculations and hospitality pay rules require configuration. Multi-rate scenarios are complex to set up. |
| **Applicant Tracking** | Hospitality-optimized: high-volume hiring workflows, text-to-apply, social recruiting, background checks, and seasonal hiring tools. | Full ATS capability but designed for lower-volume, salaried hiring. High-volume hourly hiring workflows are cumbersome. |
| **Analytics** | Labor-focused: cost %, schedule vs. actual, overtime trending, compliance risk, demand vs. staffing. Benchmarks across the hospitality industry. | Broad HR analytics. Workforce planning, headcount, turnover. Lacks hospitality-specific labor benchmarks and POS-connected analysis. |

## Competitor-Specific Talk Tracks

### vs. UKG (Pro / Ready)

> "UKG is a solid HCM platform for general workforce management. But hospitality is not general. When you look at tip management, predictive scheduling compliance, POS-driven forecasting, and the hourly mobile experience -- these are areas where a purpose-built solution outperforms a configured one. UKG customers in hospitality often still need third-party scheduling and tip management tools, which defeats the single-platform value proposition."

### vs. ADP Workforce Now

> "ADP is the payroll incumbent -- they process payroll for a huge share of US businesses. But payroll is one piece of the hospitality workforce puzzle. ADP does not offer demand forecasting, does not natively handle tip pooling, and does not enforce municipal predictive scheduling laws at the point of schedule creation. Fourth gives you payroll plus everything else hospitality needs, without the bolt-on complexity."

### vs. Ceridian Dayforce

> "Dayforce is strong on continuous pay calculation and has invested in their platform. But their hospitality story is thin. Ask about POS integration, ask about predictive scheduling rules in Portland vs. Philadelphia vs. Chicago, ask about split shift scheduling with cross-location coverage. These are table stakes in hospitality and gaps in Dayforce."

### vs. Workday

> "Workday is an enterprise HCM and finance platform. It is exceptional for corporate and salaried workforce management. It was not designed for a restaurant with 40 hourly workers running split shifts across two locations with minor labor rules and tip pooling. The implementation timeline alone -- typically 12-18 months -- tells you this is a different category of solution."

## Total Cost of Ownership

Generic HCM platforms often appear comparable or lower on license cost. **TCO tells a different story.**

| Cost Factor | Fourth | Generic HCM |
|---|---|---|
| License cost | Comparable or slightly higher per employee | Comparable or slightly lower per employee |
| Implementation | 8-12 weeks, $50K-$150K typical | 6-18 months, $200K-$1M+ typical |
| Customization | Minimal -- hospitality rules are pre-built | Extensive -- every compliance rule, tip calculation, and POS integration is custom |
| Third-party tools | None needed for hospitality workflows | Often need separate scheduling, tip management, or forecasting tools |
| Ongoing configuration | Low -- compliance rules updated by Fourth | High -- customer must update or pay for professional services |
| Time to value | 90 days to measurable labor savings | 9-18 months before full functionality is live |

**Net result:** Fourth's 3-year TCO is typically **30-40% lower** than a generic HCM platform customized for hospitality, even when the per-employee license fee is higher.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Purpose-built beats repurposed.** Hospitality compliance, tip management, and demand forecasting are not features you configure into a generic platform -- they are foundational capabilities that require domain expertise.
2. **Implementation speed is a differentiator.** 8-12 weeks vs. 6-18 months changes the ROI timeline dramatically.
3. **Mobile adoption drives value.** A platform hourly workers actually use (90%+ adoption) delivers more value than one managers use to manage workers (40-60% adoption).
4. **TCO favors Fourth** despite potentially higher license cost, because customization, third-party tools, and ongoing configuration costs are dramatically lower.
5. **Ask about POS integration, tip pooling, and predictive scheduling compliance.** These three areas expose the widest gaps in generic HCM platforms.
