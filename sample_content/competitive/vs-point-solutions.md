# Fourth vs. Point Solutions: Battle Card (7shifts, Deputy, When I Work)

## Overview

Point solutions -- 7shifts, Deputy, When I Work, Homebase, and Sling -- solve one problem well: scheduling. They are affordable, easy to set up, and popular with independent restaurants and small multi-unit operators. **Fourth is a platform** that covers the full hire-to-retire lifecycle: scheduling, labor optimization, HR, onboarding, payroll, compliance, and inventory. The competitive dynamic is straightforward: **point solutions win on simplicity below 20 locations; Fourth wins on capability and scale above 50 locations.** The 20-50 location range is the battleground.

This battle card helps sales reps position Fourth against point solutions by focusing on what happens when operators outgrow scheduling-only tools.

## Competitor-Specific Positioning

### vs. 7shifts

7shifts is the strongest point solution competitor. They have a good product, strong brand in the restaurant SMB market, and a growing feature set. **Fourth wins on:** compliance depth, payroll, HR lifecycle, enterprise scale, and AI forecasting. **7shifts wins on:** ease of setup for small operators, lower entry price, strong SMB community.

> "7shifts is a great scheduling tool for independent restaurants. As you scale past 50 locations and need multi-state compliance, integrated payroll, and enterprise HR -- that is where the platform difference shows up. Our customers who switched from 7shifts typically cite compliance gaps and the cost of managing 3-4 separate tools as the triggers."

### vs. Deputy

Deputy has broader horizontal appeal (retail, healthcare, hospitality) and a strong time & attendance product. **Fourth wins on:** hospitality specialization, compliance depth, payroll, inventory, and demand forecasting. **Deputy wins on:** cross-industry flexibility, time & attendance depth.

> "Deputy is a solid workforce management tool across industries. Fourth is purpose-built for hospitality. That means our compliance rules, tip management, POS integrations, and demand forecasting are native -- not configured. When your business is restaurants, purpose-built outperforms horizontal."

### vs. When I Work / Homebase / Sling

These are entry-level scheduling tools optimized for micro-businesses (1-10 locations). **Fourth rarely competes directly** unless the operator is growing rapidly. Position Fourth as the "graduate to" platform.

> "When I Work got you this far. Now you have 30 locations across 4 states with predictive scheduling laws, minor labor rules, and a payroll provider who does not understand tip pooling. Fourth is what you graduate to."

## The Consolidation Argument

Operators using point solutions typically run **3-5 separate tools** for their workforce:

| Function | Typical Point Solution Stack | Fourth Platform |
|---|---|---|
| Scheduling | 7shifts / Deputy | Included |
| Time & Attendance | Deputy / Homebase | Included |
| Payroll | ADP / Gusto / Paychex | Included |
| HR / Onboarding | BambooHR / manual | Included |
| Applicant Tracking | Indeed / manual | Included |
| Compliance | Manual / legal counsel | Included |

**Consolidation value:** One vendor, one data set, one support team, one invoice. Eliminates data sync issues, reduces admin time, and provides a single source of truth for labor decisions.

## Pricing Positioning

Fourth does not compete on price with point solutions at the SMB tier. The value argument is:

- **Below 20 locations:** Point solutions are often sufficient and more cost-effective. Fourth Essentials package can compete here but it is not the primary target market.
- **20-50 locations (battleground):** TCO comparison favors Fourth when you include the cost of 3-5 separate tools, manual compliance management, and admin overhead. Fourth's platform price vs. the combined point solution stack is comparable or lower.
- **Above 50 locations:** Fourth wins on capability, compliance, and scale. Point solutions cannot support the enterprise requirements (SSO, RBAC, audit trails, multi-EIN payroll) without significant workarounds.

## When to Use This Battle Card

- Prospect currently uses 7shifts, Deputy, When I Work, Homebase, or Sling
- Prospect is growing past 20-50 locations and feeling pain from tool fragmentation
- Prospect mentions compliance concerns, payroll complexity, or "too many systems"
- Prospect is evaluating both a point solution and Fourth for a new deployment
- RFP includes requirements beyond scheduling (HR, payroll, compliance, analytics)
